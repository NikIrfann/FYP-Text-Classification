Fort Saint-Michel and its bay were declared a World Heritage Site in 1979. The mystical and isolated island of Fort Saint-Michel is located in a conical arrangement of small islands made of towering granite. The bay of Saint-Malo where it is located is a tidal flat, and the tides continuously wash the sediment ashore, making the Fort Saint-Michel an isolated island, which only rises to the sea when the tide is high, which is quite mysterious. Tour Overview It is also a good place to stay if you want to catch a breathtaking view of the sunrise and dusk. To get to Fort St. Michel, you can take a car through the embankment road, or you can choose a walking plank road to enjoy the beautiful view of Fort St. Michel surrounded by the sea. Tide Watching Guide To watch the tide at Fort Saint-Michel is one of the main purposes of most tourists. The tide season is generally in spring every year, and the tidal drop can be as high as 15 meters. The parking lot at the foot of the mountain will also be submerged when the tide is high. Since the bay has little deep water and a flat bottom, the sea is 15 to 20 kilometers away from the shore at low tide. Usually the speed of high tide is equivalent to a person's walking speed - 4 kilometers per hour, and the speed increases to 30 kilometers per hour when the wind is down. Every evening, the tide of the Atlantic Ocean rushed over like a galloping horse, submerging the quicksand on the side of the mountain, and the holy mountain suddenly turned into an ocean. 6 hours after the high tide, the tide is low, and the low tide of the bay often starts very suddenly. Maybe a few minutes ago, the sea was endless and unfathomable, and suddenly the sea receded into the distance, and the beach was bare and the color on the beach was everywhere. Very special quicksand. Visiting the Saint-Michel Abbey Fort Saint-Michel is a wonder of the natural world, and the Saint-Michel Abbey on the mountain has a supreme position in the minds of Christians, its name comes from the Archangel Saint-Michel , The cardinal at that time dreamed of a sandbar in the sea for three consecutive days while practicing nearby, indicating that a church should be built here. The Saint-Michel Abbey was built in the 11th century, after which it has integrated a variety of architectural styles and is the main building of the Fort Saint-Michel. The reddish-brown stone ancient city wall is full of a strong medieval atmosphere, and the golden archangel statue on the top shines in the sun. The parquet marble floor in the main hall is very gorgeous, and the towering vault is simple and elegant. The cloisters and gardens next to the main hall are very quiet, ideal for taking a break or contemplating for a while. From the viewing platform of the cloister, you can also overlook the beautiful view of the church, the street and the beach. Visit the Saint-Michel Museum For an in-depth look at the history of Fort Saint-Michel, visit the nearby Saint-Michel Museum. There are various historical materials and exhibits related to Saint Michel Fort, Saint Michel Abbey, tides, navigation, etc., which are very interesting. In addition, the foothills of the mountain are also full of various shops and restaurants. The medieval-style storefront decoration and carved copper signboards are very distinctive. If you have enough time, you may wish to take a stroll here."

The park is located in the sixth arrondissement of Paris, the center of the Latin Quarter, and is the largest park in Paris. The park you can see today has been expanded and renovated, and it has a pleasant appearance. The rich Parisian art of living and natural scenery in the park complement each other, and art, sports, leisure and entertainment complement each other. The famous attraction of the park is the Luxembourg Palace located at the back of the garden, which is now the French Senate. The west corridor of the palace used to be the residence of Queen Maria. Since the Fifth Republic, the Luxembourg Palace has become the office of the Senate. The Luxembourg Palace can be said to be the crowning touch of the French park in the Luxembourg Gardens, complemented by the Queen Medici Fountain. Next to the Luxembourg Palace is the Luxembourg Museum, where various works of art are regularly displayed, and some temporary large-scale art exhibitions can also be held. The Luxembourg Palace is connected to the Luxembourg Museum by the Vaugirard road. There is also a tennis court in front of the museum for public use. #appreciating statues# In addition to the above two large-scale attractions, there are more than 100 statues and sculptures in the park, which appear in every corner of the park.

The roads in the garden are straight, the high canopy increases the visual permeability, and there are a lot of open spaces around the central pool and flower beds. Although the park is very large and there are many people, it does not affect the unique and comfortable atmosphere here. The scenery is beautiful and comfortable. You can see locals jogging here. There are green seats under many trees for those who come here. Many Parisians usually like to come here to sit, sit and read a book, or play chess. There are always many students and young people around the pond in the center of the park, whether they are reading, chatting, or having a picnic or a nap, they are full of leisure and energy. Photo exhibitions are often held on the fence around the park, and the music booth in the northeast corner of the park is often the venue for concerts. There are also occasional opera performances in the park. In any open space in the park, you can see the Eiffel Tower and the tallest building in Paris - Montparnasse Tower not far away. The tower is at the front right of the park and the building is at the front left. Since the original Luxembourg Palace has become the French Senate today, the park's control is slightly stricter, and the opening hours are also complicated, that is to say, it opens at about 8:00 in the morning, and closes at about 9:30 in the evening in summer, and in December in winter, it is closed. Close earlier at 4.30pm, and so on every 15 days. Family friendly and children have their own activities: playground, horse rides and puppet shows. Around the fountain in the middle of the park, children often play games with remote-controlled boats and sailboats. In addition, if you are bringing children, the children's play facilities here are not to be missed, you can swing, ride a merry-go-round and watch a puppet show here. Around the fountain in the center of the park, local children often play games with remote control boats and sailboats.

Since then, the corners of the mirror pavilion have been gradually thinned to reduce the visual weight. The view of the surrounding old port is reflected from the ceiling of the polished stainless steel mirror, as well as the faces of thousands of tourists who stop to watch, creating a strange beauty, which not only provides a place for tourists to stop and shade, but also It allows tourists to become part of the landscape when they enjoy the scenery of the old port."

The Palace of Fontainebleau is located here, surrounded by forests. The Fontainebleau Forest surrounding the palace was originally a royal hunting ground, and now it has become an outdoor sports base for bouldering enthusiasts. The bouldering season in October attracts many rock climbers from all over the world. The main building of the Palace of Fontainebleau includes a main tower, six palaces, five courtyards and four gardens. The main attractions in the palace are the ballroom, the conference hall, the chapel, the throne hall, the Diana fresco promenade, the François I promenade, the queen's bedroom, the Napoleon's living room, and the Pope's apartment. Napoleon loves yellow, and his wife Josephine prefers roses, so the overall colors of the interior decoration are mainly yellow and rose red. There are also four museums in the palace, namely the China Pavilion, the Napoleon I Pavilion, the Gallery, and the Home Pavilion. Among them, the Chinese Pavilion has a large collection of precious cultural relics from Yuanmingyuan, and displays thousands of art treasures such as ancient paintings, gold and jade jewelry, and sculptures of China's Ming and Qing Dynasties, but sometimes it is not open to visit.

The Louvre Museum was founded in 1204. The castle has undergone many expansions and was converted into a museum after the French Revolution. It is also known as the three major museums in the world together with the British Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Today, the Louvre Museum has a collection of 400,000 items spanning more than 1,500 years. The Louvre Museum usually displays 10% of its total collection which will feast your eyes.""Three Treasures of the Louvre"": ""Venus de Milo"", ""Mona Lisa"" and "" The Winged Victory of Samothrace"".
△ The Louvre’s gallery of antiquities, which replaced the royal apartments, displays masterpieces of Greek sculpture – including the famous Venus de Milo. You would need a heart of stone not to be moved by her grace!Aphrodite or Amphitrite?When she first arrived at the Louvre, it was suggested that her missing arms should be restored, but the idea was eventually abandoned for fear of changing the nature of the work.The lack of arms made it hard to identify the statue. Many depictions of Greek gods and goddesses contain clues to their identity in the form of ‘attributes’ (objects or natural elements) held in their hands, so this sculpture poses a problem: is she the sea goddess Amphitrite, particularly worshipped on the island of Melos? Or is she Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty, as might be suggested by her sensual, half-naked body? This second argument, and the jewellery she once wore, tipped the scales in favour of Aphrodite (‘Venus’ for the Romans). Another possible clue was found near the statue: a hand holding an apple – an attribute of Aphrodite – carved from the same Parian marble.
△ This is the most famous portrait in the world. It shows Lisa Gherardini, wife of the Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo – hence her Italian name La Gioconda and her French name La Joconde. Painted against a distant landscape, she stares out at us with her famously enigmatic smile...The theft of the centuryOn 21 August 1911, panic broke out at the Louvre…the Mona Lisa had disappeared! The news spread like wildfire and generous rewards were promised for her return – but all in vain. Nothing was heard of the painting for over two years. Then one day, Vincenzo Peruggia, a glazier who had worked at the Louvre, tried to sell the world’s most famous painting to an Italian art dealer...who alerted the authorities. So the Mona Lisa was recovered – and her fame was all the greater.
△ She seems to float through the air! Placed at a height, people could see her from afar. It was made as an offering to the gods for a sanctuary on the Greek island of Samothrace. Placed at a height, people could see her from afar. That is why, in a nod to her original lofty home, she now adorns the top of the Daru staircase. Nike, the winged goddess who heralds victory, is seen just as she is about to alight on a ship.A monumental staircaseThe Daru staircase is the perfect setting for this extraordinary display. It is one of six grand staircases built during the Second Empire in the 19th century by the architect Hector Lefuel.During the 1850s and 1860s, major works were underway to expand the Louvre and make it more modern. The former palace had already been partially transformed into a museum. The emperor Napoleon III had a new wing built to make more room to showcase more art. The old staircase built by his uncle Napoleon I was no longer adequate to access all the galleries. The only things left from that time are the ceilings leading to the Italian painting collections and the name Daru, a minister under Napoleon I.Hector Lefuel took up the challenge to design a new monumental space on three levels leading in four different directions. Visitors could choose themselves which way to go!The Winged Victory of Samothrace was placed in her new home on the upper landing in 1883, some 20 years after the statue was discovered."
