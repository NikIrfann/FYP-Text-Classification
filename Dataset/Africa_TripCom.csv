There are multiple angles on the mountain to overlook the cityscape of Cape Town, the vast Atlantic Ocean and the panoramic view of the famous Table Mountain. Signal Hill is also a good place to watch the Cape Town night view, which is known as one of the three major night views in the world. There are wonderful views from multiple angles on the mountain. The dazzling, crystal clear, endless fire trees and silver flowers that stretch for dozens of kilometers are breathtaking and unforgettable.

Shoes need to be taken off before boarding the ship, collected by the crew and stored in several boxes, and then barefoot, set foot on the cleaned ship. As the speedboat left the pier and sailed towards the middle of the sea, if the weather was good at this time, the water was sparkling. As the boat sailed farther and farther, the color of the water changed from green to sapphire blue, to dark blue. When you arrive at the bay, you only need to wait for the dolphins to appear.

However, if the speed is maintained, it only lasts for a short time. Bottlenose dolphins breathe through the water jets above their heads, so they have to get up to the surface every 5-8 minutes to breathe. When the dolphins appeared, all the people around began to cheer and cheer, and the whole Dolphin Bay was filled with joy. The dolphins are always near and far, and the boats keep chasing the dolphins. Whenever a dolphin swims in front of the boat, the people on the boat will be very excited and exclaimed constantly, and the dolphins will often respond to people's exclamations and jump out of the water happily. , and even a nice front flip. Dolphins sprang out of the water from time to time, exclaiming one after another. Groups of dolphins are happily swimming in the sea on the waves, at this time, you can jump into the water and swim with them in the sea, chasing them.

One is the exhibition of jewelry and musical instruments of the past dynasties, and the other is the national costumes of the past dynasties, including Berber, Saharan, Moroccan Jewish costumes, and ancient copper and earthenware utensils; the third is a high-altitude platform , which is the relic of the ancient air market. Standing on the platform, you can overlook the estuary of the Bregreg River, the ancient port of Rabat and the panoramic view of the city of Salé. The Berber houses and streets are preserved in the Udaya Fort, which is unique. Next to the fort is a group of bungalows located overseas. It was originally a Portuguese military prison. After the French occupation, it was changed to a restaurant, which has been open since then."

It is a large-scale temple complex in ancient Egypt and an ancient temple in Thebes. Founded in 2000 BC, more than 50 pharaohs participated in the construction. It was not until the 3rd century BC that the temple, which had been built for a long time in the history of civilization, was finally completed. The temple is divided into three parts by brick walls, the middle part is better preserved and the larger part, it is dedicated to the sun god Amon (Amon). The one on the left is dedicated to the god Montu, while the other is dedicated to the wife of the god Amun, the goddess Mut in the form of a vulture, but has not yet been excavated. In addition, there are dozens of temples of various sizes in the complex. There are two rows of statues with heads of sphinxes and rams on both sides of the Shinto that leads to the pylon of Karnak Temple. It is said that in history, this Shinto, guarded by a sheep-headed sphinx, leads to the Luxor Temple, which is 3 kilometers away. Throughout the temple, you can see many frescoes, statues, and pillars that use mud and stones to restore and glue the fragmented monuments together. This is because the Karnak Temple has been built more than 4,000 years ago, and it has been more than 2,000 years since its completion. Due to man-made and natural destruction, the temple was once beyond recognition. I don’t know how many years and how many archaeologists have worked hard to present the current Karnak Temple to the world."

It is said that there are more than 100 kinds of cactus alone. The garden is filled with the painter's favorite blue, and villas, vases, walls, pools, etc., all have this bright and pure blue. This blue was later called Majorelle blue. Until the painter died in a car accident in 1962, the garden was slowly abandoned. In 1980, Yves Saint Laurent and his legendary gay partner Pierre Berge discovered the Majorelle garden in Marrakech and immediately bought the garden. For nearly 30 years, the master lived in the Majorelle garden every spring. On June 1, 2008, the costume master passed away. Pierre Berge scatters his ashes in the garden to fulfill the master's wish.

From October to March of the following year, a large amount of water vapor rises to the top of the mountain after encountering Table Mountain, and then under the action of cold air A spectacular cloud formation is formed, as if a whole tablecloth covers the entire Table Mountain, which is very magnificent. There are two ways to visit Table Mountain, take the 360 revolving cable car and hike up the mountain. Since there are so many hiking trails, it is easy for tourists to get lost. A better way is to buy a mountaineering guide. The more famous ones are Maclesr's Beacon and Cicilia. However, for tourists who are new to Table Mountain, it is more recommended to take the cable car. However, it is recommended to come in good weather. If it is windy, the cable car will stop running. Even if you reach the top of the mountain on foot, you will be shrouded in fog and you will not be able to see anything. When you come to the cable car station in the middle of the mountain, you can already see the whole city of Cape Town. The cable cars run in both directions, and each one can carry 65 people. When the cable car slowly travels to the top of the mountain, through the glass windows around the cable car, you can clearly see everything under your feet. When the cable car travels halfway, you can see the wall of Table Mountain, which is as steep as a knife and an axe. You can also see rock climbers climbing the cliffs of Table Mountain. The whole process takes about 10 minutes, reaching the top of the mountain, out of the cable car building, you can see the land and rocks under your feet, from a distance, the road to the top of the mountain is so flat. When the weather is clear, you can see a blue sky in the sky. There are trails and signs on the top of the mountain, as well as signs to protect animals. Walk slowly along the rocky road to the edge of the cliff, where thick railings and handrails are built to prevent tourists from accidentally slipping. At the foot of the valley, all kinds of trees form undulating waves, and the eyes are green. In addition, the rock wall of the mountain peak is also like a knife and axe, covered with black-brown basalt rock, everywhere. Looking into the distance, the sea is thousands of waves, and the silver-white edge flashes a certain light in the slightly dimmed sunlight. Thin clouds and light smoke floated on the sea, and the sun softened a lot. The sea and the innocence are truly connected in a line, and in the misty smoke, the sea and the sky cannot be distinguished. There is a topographic map of Table Mountain on the top of the mountain, and you can take pictures with it. Standing on the east side of Table Mountain, the scenery you see is part of the Atlantic Ocean, Lion Rock and Signal Mountain. To the north of Table Mountain, you can see the endless mountains against the blue sky. To the west of Table Mountain, you can also see part of the Atlantic Ocean, as well as Table Bay, as well as the mountains connecting Table Mountain and the winding mountain road.

Detouring to the other side of Table Mountain, a viewing platform surrounded by the same stone guardrail was built on the protruding rock. Looking far from the observation deck, you can also see the bustling city of Cape Town, the blue swimming pool that almost every household has, and the beautiful Robin Island. In addition to the beautiful scenery on the top of the mountain, there are many small animals, such as small lizards, rock rabbits, squirrels, etc., they are not afraid of people, and sometimes they are allowed to take pictures in front of your camera. In the evening, when the weather is relatively clear, the sunset is sometimes dyed and hidden in the clouds, with a thin layer of crimson, which is very beautiful."

Built around 2580 BC, this pyramid is not only a symbol of Egypt, it is also the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The appearance of the pyramids To visit the Pyramid of Khufu, you must first enter the Giza Pyramid Scenic Spot. After entering, the first thing you see is the Pyramid of Khufu. It is a relatively well-preserved pyramid so far. Although the top has been weathered for a long time, it is still a A huge building with a height of 40 stories. From a distance, the pyramid is an isosceles triangle on all sides, and the entire tower is made of 2.3 million boulders. At the foot of the pyramid, you can climb a few levels symbolically. Inside the Pyramid Of course, in addition to seeing the huge appearance of the pyramid from the outside, you can also visit the inside. Although ventilation equipment is installed inside the pyramid, it will still be stuffy due to the narrow tomb passage inside the pyramid, so it is recommended that tourists with poor health do what they can. The entrance to the tomb of the pyramid is at a height of 18 meters above the ground, and the entrance faces the Big Dipper. Photography is not allowed inside the interior, and the interior corridors are illuminated. Stepping on the steep wooden stairs after entering, you can imagine the ancient Egyptians carrying the pharaoh's sarcophagus, going up the corridor, and placing the sarcophagus in the secret chamber of the pyramid. Walking up the corridor step by step in the pyramid, the footsteps will become heavier, and people will feel more and more stuffy, and then come to the Pharaoh's secret room. The secret room is a small room made of granite, 42.28 meters above the ground. For many years, people thought the pyramids contained the treasures and mummies of the pharaohs. But when archaeologists entered the pyramid in 1881, they found that there was only an empty coffin in the middle tomb. In the pharaoh's secret room, you can see an open dark red granite empty sarcophagus placed in the middle of the secret room. Back then, the pharaoh's treasure had been looted, and only this empty coffin could not be moved. You can walk in and touch the empty coffin and see the ancient Egyptian writings and patterns on the empty coffin. In the secret room, some tourists may be seen lying directly on the ground, and some tourists are sitting cross-legged and closed their eyes. They seem to want to absorb the aura of the pyramid. To this day, many people still believe that the pyramids have a special power. From the secret room, walk slowly back along the corridor. As your eyes brighten, you return to the exit. In a moment, you may have a wonderful feeling of returning to the world."
