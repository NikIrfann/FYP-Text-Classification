The Church of the Good Shepherd9.54.7/5414 Reviewsbased on 2.1k reviewNo. 1 of Top Best Things to Do in Lake TekapoChurches and CathedralsPopular Spots兔子6The Good Shepherd Church in New Zealand is made of stone, very small, and the layout of the church is very simple. The room of twenty or thirty square meters has a few rows of benches. The only highlight is that from the window of the church altar, the South Alps appear so pure and bright in front of the cross. The reason for being famous may be because it is built on the edge of Lake Tekapo, which makes people feel full of peace and beauty.New Zealand · Lake Tekapo",https://my.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/lake-tekapo/the-church-of-the-good-shepherd-95931/?locale=en-MY&curr=MYR,,,New Zealand,The Church of the Good Shepherd,"Located high on the shores of Lake Tekapo, the Church of the Good Shepherd was built in 1935 and named after a sculpture of a shepherd dog. Made entirely of rock blocks, this church is a classic postcard view of Lake Tekapo. At night, the church under the stars is even more beautiful, and it is also an excellent location for shooting star trails. 1. The appearance of the church is primitive and simple. Although it is not big, it has a unique flavor. The area of the church is only 20 to 30 square meters, which is very small. There is a small stone cross on the north roof, a small bell tower on the west side of the south roof, and a small bronze bell hangs in the arched wall hole. The outer wall of the entire church is a random combination of the original dark gray, light gray, cyan and brown of the rock, while the roof is a black stone piece. Such a primitive and rustic appearance makes it special in this open lakeside wilderness. Harmony and harmony. Although the church is small, it is very famous. During the day, there will be buses with tour groups arriving one after another. At night, you often encounter people who bring professional photography equipment to take pictures of the stars. Walking into the church, there are five or six rows of benches on the left and right sides. From the middle aisle to the pulpit by the window, a cross ten centimeters high stands in front of the glass window, against the light, outside the window is the blue sky and white clouds and the lake water. Great view, with views of Mount Cook in the distance. 2. Bronze statue of a shepherd dog next to the church A towering bronze statue of a shepherd dog can be seen not far from the church. It is used to commemorate the contribution made by the shepherd dog to protecting the flock. The statue is also engraved with ""No Shepherd"". Dogs, there would be no small town today"" and other words. 3. Look up at the starry sky and watch the unique astronomical scene. If you plan to go here in the middle of the night, you need to check whether the weather is fine in advance. When you lie on a bench by the lake and look up at the stars, you can see unique astronomical sights that can only be seen in the southern hemisphere, such as the Southern Cross constellation, the Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way satellite galaxies, etc. If you are lucky, you can even see meteors passing by night sky. With the exception of the Church of the Good Shepherd, the entire Lake Tekapo area is a good spot for stargazing as long as you stay away from street lights. Of course, if the budget is sufficient, you can also sign up for the stargazing cluster on Mount John."

Waitomo in Maori means ""surrounded by green water"". On the wall of the cave, dotted green light dots are layered upon layer upon layer. These green lights flicker on the black water, and the light and shadow are doubled. This is a wonderful world belonging to the green elves. 1. Three caves with different characteristics make up the Glowworm Cave The Glowworm Cave is mainly composed of three caves with different characteristics, Waitomo Glowworm Cave, Ruakuri Cave and Alanui Cave. The Glowworm Cave is a stalactite cave with a history of more than 10,000 years. There was a small ice-covered lake on the mountain of this cave. After the ice and snow melted, it flowed into the cracks in the rock formation below, and gradually eroded into the current cave. Cathedral Cave inside the Waitomo Glowworm Caves, this huge cave is known for its echoes of space. Ruakuri Cave is a legendary underground cave where the sound of water from an underground waterfall can be heard. The entrance of Alanui Cave is the visitor center, and the vaulted greenhouse with membrane structure is very imposing. 2. Thousands of glowworms enter the cave for a tour. You need to take a boat to enter the depths of the cave. After getting on the boat, the guide will pull the guide rope above to push the boat forward. The strange spot of light in the cave is the light emitted by thousands of fireflies. You will find patches of green and white light on the rocks. Looking closely, there are jagged translucent filaments hanging from the ceiling of the cave under the light and shadow. The silk has clear water droplets like a curtain of crystal beads. These beautiful filaments with slime are the firefly's fishing tool to attract and prey on light-following insects. This firefly has only been found in New Zealand and Australia. 3. Black Labyrinth Tour, Abyss Tour and Odyssey Tour In addition to the ""black water rafting"" in the Glowworm Cave, if you are brave enough and your endurance is good enough, you can also experience the Black Labyrinth Tour organized by the legendary black water rafting company , Journey to the Abyss and Journey to the Odyssey. These three journeys will take 3-5 hours respectively, and will involve rock climbing in caves, abseiling, and rafting on tires. Of course, if you participate in these tours, you can not only enjoy free hot showers, but also delicious hot soup and local New Zealand pancakes for you to enjoy. Plus, get a free visit to the Waitomo Caves Museum."
