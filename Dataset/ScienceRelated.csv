UNITED STATES,Day Zero Diagnostics,"The future of infectious disease diagnostics starts at Day Zero. By using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and our proprietary enabling technologies, Day Zero is creating a new class of sequencing-based in-vitro diagnostics that generates clinically actionable data at scale. Our technologies include novel sample preparation methods enabling unprecedented ultra-high enrichment of pathogen DNA for sequencing directly from clinical samples, machine learning algorithms that provide clinically actionable diagnostic results, and a world-class database of WGS and drug efficacy profiles. Day Zero Diagnostics is on a mission to transform the way infectious disease diagnostics are performed by generating the stream of real-time sequencing data required to change how we track, manage and combat infectious diseases.

With an enormous unmet clinical and economic need, we are targeting bloodstream infections and sepsis for our first application. The life expectancy of a patient with septic shock is 24 hours without fast effective antibiotic treatment. However, even when successful, current diagnostics take 2-5 days to identify the pathogen AND provide its antibiotic susceptibility profile. The lack of rapid, accurate, and comprehensive diagnostics, forces physicians to “carpet bomb” patients with severe infections with powerful, yet toxic, broad-spectrum antibiotics, which is not only ineffective in many cases but can also lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Day Zero delivers a complete diagnosis, including both the species and antibiotic resistance profile, in hours vs. days, enabling the physician to use a targeted treatment on day zero of hospital admission and resulting in better patient outcomes and cost savings",Biotechnology
