The second is the museum, which is divided into two exhibition rooms. One is the exhibition of jewelry and musical instruments of the past dynasties, and the other is the national costumes of the past dynasties, including Berber, Saharan, Moroccan Jewish costumes, and ancient copper and earthenware utensils; the third is a high-altitude platform , which is the relic of the ancient air market. Standing on the platform, you can overlook the estuary of the Bregreg River, the ancient port of Rabat and the panoramic view of the city of Salé.

It is a large-scale temple complex in ancient Egypt and an ancient temple in Thebes. Founded in 2000 BC, more than 50 pharaohs participated in the construction. It was not until the 3rd century BC that the temple, which had been built for a long time in the history of civilization, was finally completed. The temple is divided into three parts by brick walls, the middle part is better preserved and the larger part, it is dedicated to the sun god Amon (Amon). The one on the left is dedicated to the god Montu, while the other is dedicated to the wife of the god Amun, the goddess Mut in the form of a vulture, but has not yet been excavated. In addition, there are dozens of temples of various sizes in the complex. There are two rows of statues with heads of sphinxes and rams on both sides of the Shinto that leads to the pylon of Karnak Temple. It is said that in history, this Shinto, guarded by a sheep-headed sphinx, leads to the Luxor Temple, which is 3 kilometers away. Throughout the temple, you can see many frescoes, statues, and pillars that use mud and stones to restore and glue the fragmented monuments together. This is because the Karnak Temple has been built more than 4,000 years ago, and it has been more than 2,000 years since its completion. Due to man-made and natural destruction, the temple was once beyond recognition. I don’t know how many years and how many archaeologists have worked hard to present the current Karnak Temple to the world."

This blue was later called Majorelle blue. Until the painter died in a car accident in 1962, the garden was slowly abandoned. In 1980, Yves Saint Laurent and his legendary gay partner Pierre Berge discovered the Majorelle garden in Marrakech and immediately bought the garden. For nearly 30 years, the master lived in the Majorelle garden every spring. On June 1, 2008, the costume master passed away.

In addition, the rock wall of the mountain peak is also like a knife and axe, covered with black-brown basalt rock, everywhere. Looking into the distance, the sea is thousands of waves, and the silver-white edge flashes a certain light in the slightly dimmed sunlight. Thin clouds and light smoke floated on the sea, and the sun softened a lot. The sea and the innocence are truly connected in a line, and in the misty smoke, the sea and the sky cannot be distinguished. There is a topographic map of Table Mountain on the top of the mountain, and you can take pictures with it. Standing on the east side of Table Mountain, the scenery you see is part of the Atlantic Ocean, Lion Rock and Signal Mountain. To the north of Table Mountain, you can see the endless mountains against the blue sky. To the west of Table Mountain, you can also see part of the Atlantic Ocean, as well as Table Bay, as well as the mountains connecting Table Mountain and the winding mountain road. It can be said that no matter which side of Table Mountain you see, there are beautiful scenery. Detouring to the other side of Table Mountain, a viewing platform surrounded by the same stone guardrail was built on the protruding rock. Looking far from the observation deck, you can also see the bustling city of Cape Town, the blue swimming pool that almost every household has, and the beautiful Robin Island. In addition to the beautiful scenery on the top of the mountain, there are many small animals, such as small lizards, rock rabbits, squirrels, etc., they are not afraid of people, and sometimes they are allowed to take pictures in front of your camera. In the evening, when the weather is relatively clear, the sunset is sometimes dyed and hidden in the clouds, with a thin layer of crimson, which is very beautiful."

Built around 2580 BC, this pyramid is not only a symbol of Egypt, it is also the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The appearance of the pyramids To visit the Pyramid of Khufu, you must first enter the Giza Pyramid Scenic Spot. After entering, the first thing you see is the Pyramid of Khufu. It is a relatively well-preserved pyramid so far. Although the top has been weathered for a long time, it is still a A huge building with a height of 40 stories. From a distance, the pyramid is an isosceles triangle on all sides, and the entire tower is made of 2.3 million boulders. At the foot of the pyramid, you can climb a few levels symbolically. Inside the Pyramid Of course, in addition to seeing the huge appearance of the pyramid from the outside, you can also visit the inside. Although ventilation equipment is installed inside the pyramid, it will still be stuffy due to the narrow tomb passage inside the pyramid, so it is recommended that tourists with poor health do what they can. The entrance to the tomb of the pyramid is at a height of 18 meters above the ground, and the entrance faces the Big Dipper. Photography is not allowed inside the interior, and the interior corridors are illuminated. Stepping on the steep wooden stairs after entering, you can imagine the ancient Egyptians carrying the pharaoh's sarcophagus, going up the corridor, and placing the sarcophagus in the secret chamber of the pyramid. Walking up the corridor step by step in the pyramid, the footsteps will become heavier, and people will feel more and more stuffy, and then come to the Pharaoh's secret room. The secret room is a small room made of granite, 42.28 meters above the ground. For many years, people thought the pyramids contained the treasures and mummies of the pharaohs. But when archaeologists entered the pyramid in 1881, they found that there was only an empty coffin in the middle tomb. In the pharaoh's secret room, you can see an open dark red granite empty sarcophagus placed in the middle of the secret room. Back then, the pharaoh's treasure had been looted, and only this empty coffin could not be moved. You can walk in and touch the empty coffin and see the ancient Egyptian writings and patterns on the empty coffin. In the secret room, some tourists may be seen lying directly on the ground, and some tourists are sitting cross-legged and closed their eyes. They seem to want to absorb the aura of the pyramid. To this day, many people still believe that the pyramids have a special power. From the secret room, walk slowly back along the corridor. As your eyes brighten, you return to the exit. In a moment, you may have a wonderful feeling of returning to the world."

It is the landmark of Cape Town and the intersection of the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The Cape of Good Hope is located in the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve. There are actually two capes in the reserve. In addition to the Cape of Good Hope, there is another cape called Cape Cape, which is also a popular attraction in the scenic area. Although the Cape of Good Hope is in a protected area, it is accessible by car. The gate of the scenic spot is very simple. After entering, there are flowers and shrubs on both sides, and the mountains are far and wide. On the way to the Cape of Good Hope, you can see a black and white monument on the hillside in the distance. This monument commemorates the pioneer of the navigation route from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope to India - the Portuguese navigator Da Gama. The monument is on the uphill, the mountain is overgrown with weeds, and it is basically impossible to reach the foot of the monument, and can only be seen from afar. On the other side of the monument across the road, there is a monument facing the Atlantic Ocean, which is the monument of another Portuguese navigator Dias, who originally named the cape as Cape Storm. Along the way, you can also see many baboons squatting on the side of the road to rest. They are not afraid of people at all, and they take a leisurely walk or rest. There are two roads here, one leads to the Cape of Good Hope, and the other leads to the Cape of Cape. If you go to Cape Point first, drive to the entrance at the foot of the mountain, then you can take the cable car or walk up the mountain. If you walk for about half an hour, you can reach the lighthouse at the top. If you want to save your energy and choose to take the cable car, you can buy a cable car ticket at the foot of the mountain. The cable car can accommodate 40 tourists at a time, and it takes 3 minutes to go up the mountain one way. Operating hours: Monday-Sunday 9:00-17:30. In addition, there is a shop specializing in souvenirs at the foot of the mountain.

When the weather is clear, the colors of the blue sky and sea water complement each other, making people linger. There is an old lighthouse on Cape Point, which is also a landmark of the Cape of Good Hope. Climb up dozens of steps to reach the old lighthouse, which is no longer in use. Under the old lighthouse is a large stone with graffiti from tourists from all over the world. There is also a wooden pole in front of the old lighthouse. There are several signs pointing in different directions on the wooden pole. It says the distance from here to major cities around the world. You can find it is 12,933 kilometers away from the capital. Standing on the top of the mountain, in addition to the stunning sea view, you can also overlook the Cape of Good Hope not far away. The Cape of Good Hope is the boundary between the cold Atlantic current and the warm Indian current. You can see a clear dividing line between light blue and dark blue on the sea. On your left is the Indian Ocean and on your right is the Atlantic Ocean. After seeing the dividing line between the two oceans, you can go around the lighthouse and continue to move forward. At this time, you may wish to look back at the scene of the top of Cape Point, and you will find that it is unusually majestic. Continue forward to the end, here is the southern end of Cape Point. You can see a new lighthouse that is currently in use at Cape Point not far in front of you, and the lighthouse on the top of the mountain that you just saw is relatively high. If the sea is foggy, ships on the sea will often not be able to see it. , so the new lighthouse was rebuilt closer to the sea. The new lighthouse is located under a rocky cliff, which is inaccessible to tourists, but you can learn about the history of the lighthouse through a stone tablet at the end. After going up and down from Cape Point, you can head to the Cape of Good Hope. The Cape of Good Hope is a small protruding headland, where there is a lot of weather and wonderful scenery. When the weather is clear, you can see clear blue sky, deep blue water, brown reefs and white spray, as well as refreshing sea breeze and flocks of free-flying seabirds. You can take a walk on the beach on the edge of the Cape of Good Hope. The beach here is different from your impression. It is full of rocks, and the wind and waves are very strong. If the weather is not cold, you can walk slowly to the reef close to the sea. On the edge, touch the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, but be careful with your feet so as not to slip. There are also many piles of kelp washed up by the sea on the beach. It is not allowed to sell kelp here, but you can pick up one and take a photo. Walking to the other end of the beach, there is a long golden sign commemorative plaque. The half-person-high commemorative plaque is made up of three pieces. The left is English, the right is Afrikaans, which is Afrikaans, and the middle is The exact latitude and longitude of the Cape of Good Hope is 18°28'26""E, 34°21'25""S. This is also a place where every visitor to the Cape of Good Hope takes a group photo. You may wish to take a photo here to prove that you have been here. If you are reluctant to leave after the visit, you may as well go to the restaurant in the scenic spot to sit. This restaurant named TwoOceans is located on the top of the mountain, not far from the cable car drop-off station. The restaurant has a great view of the stunning ocean view of False Bay."

Fort Saint-Michel and its bay were declared a World Heritage Site in 1979. The mystical and isolated island of Fort Saint-Michel is located in a conical arrangement of small islands made of towering granite. The bay of Saint-Malo where it is located is a tidal flat, and the tides continuously wash the sediment ashore, making the Fort Saint-Michel an isolated island, which only rises to the sea when the tide is high, which is quite mysterious. Tour Overview It is also a good place to stay if you want to catch a breathtaking view of the sunrise and dusk. To get to Fort St. Michel, you can take a car through the embankment road, or you can choose a walking plank road to enjoy the beautiful view of Fort St. Michel surrounded by the sea. Tide Watching Guide To watch the tide at Fort Saint-Michel is one of the main purposes of most tourists. The tide season is generally in spring every year, and the tidal drop can be as high as 15 meters. The parking lot at the foot of the mountain will also be submerged when the tide is high. Since the bay has little deep water and a flat bottom, the sea is 15 to 20 kilometers away from the shore at low tide. Usually the speed of high tide is equivalent to a person's walking speed - 4 kilometers per hour, and the speed increases to 30 kilometers per hour when the wind is down. Every evening, the tide of the Atlantic Ocean rushed over like a galloping horse, submerging the quicksand on the side of the mountain, and the holy mountain suddenly turned into an ocean. 6 hours after the high tide, the tide is low, and the low tide of the bay often starts very suddenly. Maybe a few minutes ago, the sea was endless and unfathomable, and suddenly the sea receded into the distance, and the beach was bare and the color on the beach was everywhere. Very special quicksand. Visiting the Saint-Michel Abbey Fort Saint-Michel is a wonder of the natural world, and the Saint-Michel Abbey on the mountain has a supreme position in the minds of Christians, its name comes from the Archangel Saint-Michel , The cardinal at that time dreamed of a sandbar in the sea for three consecutive days while practicing nearby, indicating that a church should be built here. The Saint-Michel Abbey was built in the 11th century, after which it has integrated a variety of architectural styles and is the main building of the Fort Saint-Michel. The reddish-brown stone ancient city wall is full of a strong medieval atmosphere, and the golden archangel statue on the top shines in the sun. The parquet marble floor in the main hall is very gorgeous, and the towering vault is simple and elegant. The cloisters and gardens next to the main hall are very quiet, ideal for taking a break or contemplating for a while. From the viewing platform of the cloister, you can also overlook the beautiful view of the church, the street and the beach. Visit the Saint-Michel Museum For an in-depth look at the history of Fort Saint-Michel, visit the nearby Saint-Michel Museum. There are various historical materials and exhibits related to Saint Michel Fort, Saint Michel Abbey, tides, navigation, etc., which are very interesting. In addition, the foothills of the mountain are also full of various shops and restaurants. The medieval-style storefront decoration and carved copper signboards are very distinctive. If you have enough time, you may wish to take a stroll here."

The creation of this cultural and artistic center was the brainchild of President Georges Pompidou and was later completed in 1969 by several well-known architects including Richard Rogers. The modern look of this behemoth is made of steel and glass pipes, and the exterior walls are covered in colorful pipes and steel trusses that you can tell by color: blue for the air-conditioning exhaust system, yellow for the power system, and green pipes for the water pipes. In the giant transparent cylindrical pipes, the escalators are busy transporting visitors to various floors, and you can also enjoy the scenery outside through the glass when taking the elevator. The whole building is like a construction site under construction. It is entrenched in the elegant and beautiful ancient buildings in Paris. It is particularly unconventional. Some people jokingly call it ""the oil refinery in the city center"". How to visit the Centre Pompidou, including the public information library, the French Museum of Modern Art and Acoustics, the Music Research Association, as well as numerous exhibition halls, shops, restaurants and cinemas. Tickets for each exhibition hall are different and can be purchased as appropriate, and the first Sunday of each month is free. There is also a luggage storage office, a café, a souvenir shop, a bookstore and a children's playroom on the ground floor lobby, and an architectural model of the entire Pompidou Cultural Center is displayed. There are cinemas, activity rooms and performance halls on the second floor. Exhibitions, literary and philosophical seminars are held from time to time. You can also watch movies here, enjoy concerts, drama performances, etc. The number of performances and ticket prices can be checked on the official website. The third and fourth floors of the Pompidou National Center for Culture and Art are open-shelf libraries, which have a large collection of books and are easy to borrow. It is a public library often visited by locals, and borrowing is free. The National Museum of Modern Art on the fifth and sixth floors is a place where many tourists will visit. You can admire many incredible modern and postmodern art works, such as Cezanne's ""Mona Lisa with a Beard"" , some works of Pop Art pioneer Marshall Reese, etc. If you are not interested in modern art, you can go to the seventh floor of the Pompidou Cultural Center, where there is a viewing platform, where you can overlook the panoramic view of Paris, overlooking the Montmartre district and the Sacré Coeur. The sloping venue in front of the Pompidou National Cultural and Art Center is the Pompidou Square, which can accommodate spontaneous entertainment activities and open-air performances. This allows the restoration of traditional street art and becomes a ""paradise"" for the free activities of street performers."

The Louvre Museum was founded in 1204. The castle has undergone many expansions and was converted into a museum after the French Revolution. It is also known as the three major museums in the world together with the British Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Today, the Louvre Museum has a collection of 400,000 items spanning more than 1,500 years. The Louvre Museum usually displays 10% of its total collection which will feast your eyes.""Three Treasures of the Louvre"": ""Venus de Milo"", ""Mona Lisa"" and "" The Winged Victory of Samothrace"".
△ The Louvre’s gallery of antiquities, which replaced the royal apartments, displays masterpieces of Greek sculpture – including the famous Venus de Milo. You would need a heart of stone not to be moved by her grace!Aphrodite or Amphitrite?When she first arrived at the Louvre, it was suggested that her missing arms should be restored, but the idea was eventually abandoned for fear of changing the nature of the work.The lack of arms made it hard to identify the statue. Many depictions of Greek gods and goddesses contain clues to their identity in the form of ‘attributes’ (objects or natural elements) held in their hands, so this sculpture poses a problem: is she the sea goddess Amphitrite, particularly worshipped on the island of Melos? Or is she Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty, as might be suggested by her sensual, half-naked body? This second argument, and the jewellery she once wore, tipped the scales in favour of Aphrodite (‘Venus’ for the Romans). Another possible clue was found near the statue: a hand holding an apple – an attribute of Aphrodite – carved from the same Parian marble.
△ This is the most famous portrait in the world. It shows Lisa Gherardini, wife of the Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo – hence her Italian name La Gioconda and her French name La Joconde. Painted against a distant landscape, she stares out at us with her famously enigmatic smile...The theft of the centuryOn 21 August 1911, panic broke out at the Louvre…the Mona Lisa had disappeared! The news spread like wildfire and generous rewards were promised for her return – but all in vain. Nothing was heard of the painting for over two years. Then one day, Vincenzo Peruggia, a glazier who had worked at the Louvre, tried to sell the world’s most famous painting to an Italian art dealer...who alerted the authorities. So the Mona Lisa was recovered – and her fame was all the greater.
△ She seems to float through the air! Placed at a height, people could see her from afar. It was made as an offering to the gods for a sanctuary on the Greek island of Samothrace. Placed at a height, people could see her from afar. That is why, in a nod to her original lofty home, she now adorns the top of the Daru staircase. Nike, the winged goddess who heralds victory, is seen just as she is about to alight on a ship.A monumental staircaseThe Daru staircase is the perfect setting for this extraordinary display. It is one of six grand staircases built during the Second Empire in the 19th century by the architect Hector Lefuel.During the 1850s and 1860s, major works were underway to expand the Louvre and make it more modern. The former palace had already been partially transformed into a museum. The emperor Napoleon III had a new wing built to make more room to showcase more art. The old staircase built by his uncle Napoleon I was no longer adequate to access all the galleries. The only things left from that time are the ceilings leading to the Italian painting collections and the name Daru, a minister under Napoleon I.Hector Lefuel took up the challenge to design a new monumental space on three levels leading in four different directions. Visitors could choose themselves which way to go!The Winged Victory of Samothrace was placed in her new home on the upper landing in 1883, some 20 years after the statue was discovered."

Unlike the town of Fira, which has a slightly more commercial flavor, the main purpose of most tourists here is to enjoy the sunset here. It is said that ""the sunset falls into the Aegean Sea"" can be seen here. The sunset view of the small town of Oia has been used as a source of inspiration by many artists and photographers. White houses, blue-roofed churches, and traditional windmills are always intoxicating under the setting sun. Whenever the sun goes down, tourists will always flock here, find a good place to watch the sunset and sit quietly for an hour, watching the sun go down slowly and disappear into the horizon, leaving only a crimson on the sea. Afterglow, the whole world calms down. Tourists can't help clapping their hands and applauding, praising this beautiful sunset. There are two platforms on the west side of the town, one is a seaside platform similar to the beacon tower, and the other is a small square under the windmill. These two places are good places to watch the sunset. Of course, you can also choose a restaurant with a good view and enjoy the food while watching the sunset. But remember to arrive early, otherwise you won't be able to get a seat. A seafood feast with Santorini specialty wine, and the sunset is very romantic. After nightfall, the small town of Oia still has a restless heart. There are various bars and nightclubs here. If you don’t go to nightclubs, you can also choose to go shopping. The small shops between the narrow alleys of Qingshi are usually open until one or two in the morning, so it is still crowded with people late at night, and the lights inside and outside the store are bright. Due to the relatively long sunshine hours in summer in Greece, the sun will only go down at 7 or 8 o'clock every night, so you still have enough time to visit other scenery of the town during the day. You can go to the Blue Roof Church to see, maybe you will meet the newlyweds who are having a wedding. Take a walk along the footpath of the town and see the white and blue huts from afar, blending in with the sky and the sea, and you can take pictures here. In addition, if economic conditions permit, you can choose to stay here for one night, choose that kind of Villa, open the window and face the sea, so that you can feel the dream-like scenery, which is very romantic."

Origin of Condor Plaza In 2003, the Indonesian government started construction of Condor Plaza. It plans to build a statue of the Hindu God of Destruction and its mount condor on the mountain. The overall height will reach more than 100 meters. It is said that an eminent monk once instructed Suharto that after the bronze statue is cast, it will bless the prosperity of the Indonesian nation and the happiness and safety of the people, but Suharto stepped down before the square was completed, so this hugely expensive project was put on hold.” The upper body, hands, and the head of the condor were scattered in different parts of the square. Despite the statue of Condor Plaza, the ""unfinished project"" of Condor Plaza is still worth seeing. From Jimbaran to the south, along JlUluwatu Street, you can come to the hill where Condor Plaza is located. After entering the door and walking up the stairs, you will see a snake wearing a laurel crown and a slender body coiled on one side. This hill is about 200 meters high. When you come to the top of the mountain, you can see the huge bronze statue of ""Destruction God"" Vishnu. Although only the head and chest are completed, the lifelike facial expressions are still very vivid. Deterrent. The arm of the ""God of Destruction"" was placed beside a small road in the middle of the mountain, so you can look for it. Going further inside, you will see the head statue of a giant condor overlooking the flat square in front of you. This square was dug down from the mountain with a large excavator. The tall and neat stone walls around the square were originally intended to be carved with Hindu inscriptions and stories of mythical figures."

Bologna was always known as the city of towers, “La Turrita”, as over the centuries, particularly between the 12th and the 13th century, the city had possibly over 200 towers.Almost all them were tall (the highest being 97 m), defensive stone towers. There are now 25 towers left without counting the hundreds of bell towers in the city.The taller one of the pair is called the Asinelli while the smaller but more leaning tower is called the Garisenda. Their names derive from the families which are traditionally credited with constructing them between 1109 and 1119.The Asinelli Tower was used by the scientists Giovanni Battista Riccioli (in 1640) and Giovanni BattistaGuglielmini (in the following century) for experiments to study the motion of heavy bodies and the earth rotation. Bologna’s towers were cited several times by Dante in the Divine Comedy and The Rhymes (a confirmation of his stay in Bologna), and by Goethe in his Italian Journey. The Two Towers have also been the subject of an eponymous poem by Giosuè Carducci as part of the Barbarian Odes. Charles Dickens wrote about the towers in his Pictures from Italy.In World War II, between 1943 and 1945, it was used as a sight post: during bombing attacks, four volunteers took post at the top to direct rescue operations to places hit by Allied bombs.Later, a RAI television relay was installed on top.Architect Minor Yamasaki is thought to have been inspired by the Towers when designing the World Trade Center during the 1960s.Italy · Metropolitan City of Bologna",https://my.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/bologna/two-towers-18696085/?locale=en-MY&curr=MYR,7.0,https://my.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/italy-100026/tourist-attractions/7.html/,Two Towers,"The twin towers, one high and the other low, are the iconic buildings of Bologna.

As a result, the former tower collapsed due to the unstable foundation. It was only 48 meters high, and the inclination was 4.0°, which was more inclined than the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa.

The Basilica of Santa Croce is also known as ""the Pantheon of Italy"", where 276 great Italians such as Galileo, Michelangelo, Machievilla and Marconi are buried. The church is also decorated with exquisite masterpieces by many art masters, which can be called the condensed essence of Renaissance architecture and art. The French writer Stendhal once wrote: ""Slowly, the Church of the Holy Cross gradually appeared in front of me. My My heart began to feel uneasy... My whole body seemed to lose strength, and every step I took seemed to be about to fall."" This is where ""Stendhal Syndrome"" comes from. Santa Croce was built in 1924 and designed by Florentine architect Arnolfo DiCambio. The Gothic facade seen now was built on the occasion of the centenary of Dante's birth in the 19th century. On the side stands a statue of Dante. Colorful marbles of different shapes adorn the grand façade, and the top of the main entrance has a large satellite pattern designed by Jewish architect Matas."

Take the elevator of the church to the top and overlook the whole city of Rome. The whole square is like a key. Two semi-circular colonnades formed by four rows of Doric columns form a huge ellipse, which surrounds the whole in an arc. The piazza then extends towards the cathedral, which, in Bernini's view, represents the arms of the church open to embrace the world. There are more than 140 sculptures on the colonnade of the square, all completed by Bernini and his students, all of which are religious figures. In the center of the square is the obelisk that Caligula brought back to Rome from Heliopolis. There are two fountains on both sides of the Piazza Fountain. The one on the right was built by Maderno in the 17th century, and the one on the left was a replica designed and later repaired by Bernini. Standing on the white marble between the column and the fountain, looking at the columns in the promenade, it is incredible that the 4 columns seem to have only one, and Bernini's great accomplishments can also be seen from here!

The Doge's Palace was originally a Byzantine-style defensive castle, and the huge expenditure when it was established showed the power and wealth of the Republic of Venice at that time. Architectural Style The present building was mainly constructed between 1309 and 1424. In 1574, the Governor's Palace was severely damaged by a fire. Although the designers of the time submitted designs in the neoclassical style, subsequent reconstructions continued the original Gothic style. However, there are also some classicist features, such as the Bridge of Sighs, built since the 16th century, through which the Doge's Palace is connected to the prison. Today, the Doge's Palace is a museum where visitors can admire paintings of Venice depicted by Tintoretto and Veronese. The Governor's Palace, which has a ㄇ-shaped internal structure, is divided into three floors, and the two sides facing the square and the wharf are its main walls. In a geometric pattern of white and rose marble, a solid wall is placed on the third floor, with A-line lace interspersed with gothic flame-shaped minarets on the upper edge. The second floor is a Gothic pointed-vault loggia decorated with four-leaf ornaments, and the Gothic arcade on the lower floor is supported by columns to support the two arches on the second floor. This not only subtly breaks the traditional Gothic design, but also subverts the traditional architectural principles to overcome the problem of the top heavy and the bottom light. It retains the original Byzantine concept and integrates the Gothic design to become a light and slender masterpiece of Venetian Gothic architecture. . Buy a ticket from the ticket entrance on the Slavic Embankment. There is a simple map behind the ticket, indicating the location of the Doge's Palace, St. Mark's Basilica and the adjacent Craft Museum.

Here you can see the ""onion head"" dome of the adjoining St. Mark's Basilica, with a clock-shaped marble facade on it. The first floor of the cloister on the three sides of the courtyard is a Renaissance-style regular round arch, and the second floor is a Gothic pointed arch, which is different from the Gothic pointed arch in the facade of the Governor's Palace. On the promenade on the second floor, there are several lion mouths in the shape of a lion's head, which are used to receive anonymous reporting letters. The public only needs to put the letter into the mouth of the lion. At that time, the Venice government encouraged whistleblowers and protected whistleblowers. Three locks were specially set up in the mailbox, which must be opened by three persons with three keys. In addition, standing on the sky balcony of the promenade on the second floor, you can overlook St. Mark's Square and the lagoon. There are 8 statues from the ancient Greek period in the courtyard. There are two finely carved bronze water wells on the ground in the courtyard, which are considered to be exquisite works of Venice in the 16th century. This well can absorb water from the outside waterway to the atrium for storage. In the past, it was the best quality water in Venice. Every day, many traders came to the Doge's Palace to fetch water, and then took the well water to distant areas to sell it. Then came to the official starting point of the tour route - the golden stairs, from which you entered the interior of the Governor's Palace.

From the ceiling to the surrounding walls, there are magnificent decorations everywhere. However, according to the regulations here, photography is not allowed above the second floor. The main halls of the Governor's Mansion include the Map Hall, the Four Entrance Halls, the Conference Hall, the Ten-person Hall, the Elder Hall and the Grand Conference Hall. The walls of the map hall are decorated with world maps, and two huge globes are kept inside. In the conference hall, there is Tintoretto's giant mural ""Paradise"", which is based on Dante's ""The Divine Comedy"". There are more than 700 figures in the painting, which is called the world's largest oil painting. After visiting the various halls, go to the armory displaying various weapons, guns, ammunition and armor, which preserves the weapons of the Crusades, the first machine gun imitated according to Da Vinci's design, and the shocking chastity belt . Then the passage becomes dark and you will come to the cell located in the basement of the Doge's Palace. The number of prison cells at that time was not enough, so a new prison was built next to the palace, which became an independent building for the purpose of imprisoning prisoners in history, and the Bridge of Sighs connecting the two places was also built."

It was selected as a world cultural heritage by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is actually an independent bell tower of the Cathedral of Pisa, located in the central square of Pisa, the Miracle Square. The square is full of people, and it is common for tourists to stretch out their arms and pose for pictures with the Leaning Tower in all kinds of whimsical shapes. Leaning Tower Construction History and Leaning Reasons The Leaning Tower of Pisa is more than 20 meters away from the cathedral. It has a cylindrical appearance and is made of white marble. The year of construction engraved in Latin on the base of the tower was 1174, and it was completed in 1350; but in fact, the calendar used in ancient Pisa was one year earlier than the Gregorian calendar, so the year of construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was 1173. It is said that the Leaning Tower of Pisa was built with six trophies brought in by the Pisa fleet. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is 54.5 meters high and 16 meters in diameter. In the early stages of construction, the leaning tower tilted an average of 1 mm per year, and construction was temporarily suspended. Most believe the slope is due to uneven foundations and soft soil layers. In 1998, workers wrapped cables on the third tier, attached it to the frame, and removed some of the deposited soil to the north to bring the leaning tower into equilibrium. There are 213 arches on each floor of the leaning tower overlooking the city of Pisa. There are 294 spiral steps in the tower, for tourists to climb the tower and overlook the scenery of the whole city. Some steps are slippery, so you need to pay attention to your feet. In summer evenings, you can enjoy the beautiful night view of Pisa from the Leaning Tower. The experience of entering the Leaning Tower is very special. When you walk down the very narrow spiral staircase, you will feel as if you are on a boat. When you reach the top of the tower, the vision is suddenly clear. There is glass at the top of the tower, because the interior of the tower is hollow, so the ground floor can be seen directly through the glass. The process of climbing the tower is now limited by time and number of people. You need to go to the ticket office to book tickets in advance, or if you want to avoid long queues, you can buy tickets on the official website and print them out. Ticket holders to the summit should gather at the designated place in advance. The staff will first introduce the history of the Leaning Tower for 5 minutes, and then a special person will lead the team to climb the tower. Only 15 people are arranged in each batch, and the stay on the tower shall not exceed 30 minutes. If you feel that the Leaning Tower is too expensive, you can walk around the Leaning Tower, or visit the churches and museums on the square. There are many pedestrian streets near the scenic spot, and various handicrafts are sold in small shops."

Standing on the platform in front of the church, you can overlook the entire Plaza de España. In addition, the more famous scenic spot on the square is a Baroque art fountain in front of the steps, which is called the Broken Ship Fountain. The original fountain was small and inconspicuous, and because of the low water pressure, even the water in the fountain was tiny. The designer made a boat that was half-submerged in the pool outside the original fountain. The water from the fountain first flows into the broken ship, and then slowly overflows from the four sides of the ship. In addition, the entire fountain is almost as high as the street level, and it really feels like a leaking ship is about to sink into the ground. In ""Roman Holiday"", Hepburn is sitting on the steps next to the fountain, eating ice cream. Many tourists stand at the fountain and take their cameras up to take pictures, so that they can take a panoramic view of the Spanish Steps and the Holy Trinity Church.

The Keats Shelley Memorial is next to the Spanish Steps. The memorial hall displays their manuscripts, letters, photos and other rich materials, and is a must-see for literature lovers."

It is a grass park in the second construction site of Lanzhi Island. It used to be an area with poor soil on Lanzhi Island. Sky Park is famous for its 291 steps, from which you can overlook the panoramic view of Seoul. Boundless Grass Sky Park is characterized by a vast expanse of grass. The ridge line made for the convenience of drainage is the boundary line, and it is divided into 4 areas according to the X-shape. The taller grass is planted on the north and south sides, and the short grass is planted on the east and west sides. In the north of the tall grasslands, there are purple awns. In the rippling purple awn group, citizens can feel the nature. In the low grasslands, there are native varieties such as large thistle, violet and bitterweed, and naturalized varieties such as white alfalfa. Among them, white alfalfa can help other plants grow and promote soil decomposition, which is a very suitable plant for places like Laneige Island. Since 2,000 years ago, more than 30,000 butterflies, including yellow butterflies, blue swallowtail butterflies, nymph butterflies, and golden swallowtail butterflies, have been released on Lanzhi Island with Sky Park as the center. In spring and early summer, butterflies flying in the sky help pollinate plants, which has greatly contributed to the stability of the plant ecosystem in Laneige Island. Another feature of walking up the stairs and looking at Yuanjing Sky Park is that there will be 219 steps along the road, and each step is marked with numbers. Walking up the steps is like walking towards the sky step by step, standing in the Sky Park on Lanzhi Island. From here, the scenery of Seoul catches your eye at a glance, with Bukhan Mountain in the north, Namsan Mountain and 63 Building in the east gate, Han River in the south, and Lucky State Mountain Fortress in the west. In order to take full advantage of such excellent viewing conditions, there is an observation deck on the inclined surface, so that visitors can rest at any time. The bushes outside the park are 1~1.5m higher than the grass, and many large trees like oaks are planted to allow visitors to rest in the shade."

Walking through the bridge and entering the artificial island, you can see a big unfinished hotel. The merchants on the ground floor of the building are also closed, so there will be some desolation and a little terror along the way. On the left side of the mosque entrance, you can borrow halal costumes for free. The mosque extends from the sea to the sea, so it is really not an exaggeration to call it a sea mosque. The central area of worship cannot be visited, but you can detour from both sides to the side of the mosque by the sea. This mosque is not as big as the Blue Mosque in Kuala Lumpur, but it is still very popular to take pictures. Give some suggestions: 1. On the left side of the mosque, you can take pictures of the mosque that extends to the sea. 2. On the side of the mosque sea, you can also take a few pictures. 3.

About 5 years ago, Ernest Zacharevic, a Lithuanian artist, came to the century-old street in Penang. At first, it was just an unintentional backpacking trip, but he did not expect it to become his creative base, and even more unexpectedly gave Penang Old Street different from the vitality of the past. His mural is a work of art from MirrorsGeorgetown. In 2012, in order to coincide with Penang's celebration of the 4th anniversary of George Town's entry into the World Cultural Heritage, the Penang Arts Council listed ""George Town Mirror"" as one of the celebration activities. Officially, because of such a celebration, so many works of life are displayed in front of us. Penang's murals are scattered in the streets and alleys of George Town, and you can see it when you walk around the streets. According to the map, you can connect some scenic spots and murals to design a reasonable play route. If you don’t have enough time, you can also choose to ride a bicycle or take a human-powered tricycle. The cost of renting a bicycle is about 70 yuan a day, and the cost of a tricycle is 40 ringgit an hour. The advantage of the rickshaw is that the drivers are all locals, who are relatively familiar with these murals, and it saves time to play. Tour Guide Whether it is from the Everbright Building, Surname Bridge or Love Lane, it is a good sightseeing route. At present, there are more than 20 murals and 52 iron sculpture cartoons in George Town, which are distributed on the streets of LebuhChulia, LebuhAhQuee, LebuhVictoria and LebuhArmenian. Ernest Zacharevic has 8 murals here. ""Photo with the Old Man"" on LebuhArmenian Street, this is his first work, the fresco has begun to fade due to the age. There is also a well-known copy of ""Sister and Brother Riding Together"" on this street. In the picture, an older sister who is not very skilled in driving takes her excited and nervous younger brother on a bicycle and does not know where to go. Many tourists will put out the action of pushing the back seat of the bicycle, or the action of actually riding the bicycle behind them, which is very interesting. In addition, several well-known works are ""Broken Heart"" by Love Lane, ""Kung Fu Girl"" by LebuhMuntri, ""The Boy Who Chased the Wind"" by LebuhAhQuee Street, and ""The Resting Tricycle Driver"" by PenangRoad Wait. Today, in addition to the original murals, Chinese painter Chen Yukang has created many art works about cats together with the ""101 Lost Cats"" organization. In addition, Penang also has a ""Sign George Town Project"", which uses comic-style iron sculpture murals to tell the legends of the old street or the life of the citizens. A total of 52 iron plastic cartoons for the ""Sign George Town Project"" are the works of SculptureAtWork, a local art group that won the ""Sign George Town Project"" competition. As long as you walk on the streets of Penang, you will always find many vivid and interesting cartoons, which will add some childishness to the nostalgic Penang."

Three-quarters of the entire mosque is built on Lake Brat, also known as the Water Mosque. It's visually stunning thanks to its pink dome topped with granite. The construction of the mosque started in 1997 at a huge cost and can accommodate 15,000 people. The exterior is all pink, quite soft in color, and built with a lot of rose marble. The mosque has nine domes and can reach a height of 50 meters. Standing on Prince Edward Square is a good spot to photograph the exterior of the mosque. Between the blue sky, white clouds and clear water, the pink sanctuary is so beautiful that you can't take your eyes off it. It is not like the Forbidden City in Beijing, as red as a red flame rose. This mosque is more like a pink holy lotus blooming on the water, with a clear rhythm and a pure dream. The mosque is mainly composed of three parts: the prayer hall, the big minaret and the mausoleum. The roof of the hall looks like an open umbrella. It consists of 49 large and small round arches with 18 radiating stars, representing the 13 states of the country and the five commandments of Islam. The shape of the spire of the big minaret is like a rocket, the whole tower is 73 meters high, and there are elevators and stairs leading to the upper end. The mausoleum is built behind the mosque, where only the national heroes of Islam are buried. Most of the people who came to the mosque were tour groups from China and India. Because of time constraints, most of these tour groups just took pictures on the outside. If you are an independent tourist, you can visit it if you have enough time, because the interior of the mosque is actually more magnificent than the dreamy appearance.

All visitors must be properly dressed and not revealing when entering. Quiet loud noises in the temple, no smoking. Therefore, whether it is a boy or a girl, you can get a red or blue robe for free at the entrance, wear it on your body, and wear a hat at the same time.

In addition, the shoes must also be taken off, you can put them on the rack specially for shoes, just remember where you put them. After entering, there will be a staff member who will explain it for free. Photography is prohibited in the prayer hall, please strictly abide by it. There are no idols in the temple, because Muslims do their prayers in the direction of Mecca. The mosque is divided into two floors, the second floor can be used exclusively by 4,000 women, and the downstairs can be used by 8,000 men. Muslims will worship at a certain time every day. At this time, the sound of the Koran played in the high minaret of the mosque lingers melodiously in the sky above the mosque, which is very pleasant. The design of the mosque is quite environmentally friendly. The prayer hall is very spacious. There are 12 pillars in it. The center of the pillars is a vacuum design. When the weather is hot, the motor at the bottom of the lake can be pumped into the interior, so it will feel slightly cool when entering the mosque.

I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone!

Three-quarters of the entire mosque is built on Lake Brat, also known as the Water Mosque. It's visually stunning thanks to its pink dome topped with granite. The construction of the mosque started in 1997 at a huge cost and can accommodate 15,000 people. The exterior is all pink, quite soft in color, and built with a lot of rose marble. The mosque has nine domes and can reach a height of 50 meters. Standing on Prince Edward Square is a good spot to photograph the exterior of the mosque. Between the blue sky, white clouds and clear water, the pink sanctuary is so beautiful that you can't take your eyes off it. It is not like the Forbidden City in Beijing, as red as a red flame rose. This mosque is more like a pink holy lotus blooming on the water, with a clear rhythm and a pure dream. The mosque is mainly composed of three parts: the prayer hall, the big minaret and the mausoleum. The roof of the hall looks like an open umbrella. It consists of 49 large and small round arches with 18 radiating stars, representing the 13 states of the country and the five commandments of Islam. The shape of the spire of the big minaret is like a rocket, the whole tower is 73 meters high, and there are elevators and stairs leading to the upper end. The mausoleum is built behind the mosque, where only the national heroes of Islam are buried. Most of the people who came to the mosque were tour groups from China and India. Because of time constraints, most of these tour groups just took pictures on the outside. If you are an independent tourist, you can visit it if you have enough time, because the interior of the mosque is actually more magnificent than the dreamy appearance. There is a red sign at the entrance of the mosque that says that non-Muslims, women who are menstruating and children under the age of five are not allowed to enter the prayer hall. All visitors must be properly dressed and not revealing when entering. Quiet loud noises in the temple, no smoking. Therefore, whether it is a boy or a girl, you can get a red or blue robe for free at the entrance, wear it on your body, and wear a hat at the same time. Girls can't show their hair, and there will be staff reminding them all the time. In addition, the shoes must also be taken off, you can put them on the rack specially for shoes, just remember where you put them. After entering, there will be a staff member who will explain it for free. Photography is prohibited in the prayer hall, please strictly abide by it. There are no idols in the temple, because Muslims do their prayers in the direction of Mecca. The mosque is divided into two floors, the second floor can be used exclusively by 4,000 women, and the downstairs can be used by 8,000 men. Muslims will worship at a certain time every day. At this time, the sound of the Koran played in the high minaret of the mosque lingers melodiously in the sky above the mosque, which is very pleasant. The design of the mosque is quite environmentally friendly. The prayer hall is very spacious. There are 12 pillars in it. The center of the pillars is a vacuum design. When the weather is hot, the motor at the bottom of the lake can be pumped into the interior, so it will feel slightly cool when entering the mosque. In addition, you can also see some Koran decorations in the temple, and there is a yellow explanatory diagram on the wall, telling people the correct mode of worship. In addition, the mosque has an auditorium with a capacity of 380 people and two classrooms, where lectures and lectures can be held. If you are hungry, there is also a mosque restaurant here, which can be used for tourists to eat and also to hold some religious events."

Lake Rotorua is the largest lake in the area. The city name is also derived from it. The south side of the lake is the urban area. Lake Rotorua is also the third largest lake in New Zealand.

Lake Rotorua. There are countless hot springs in Rotorua. If you take two steps, you will see a mass of heat floating in the air. Sometimes three or two springs are gathered together, and the water mist is like a fairyland. The geothermal city lives up to its name. There is a faint smell of sulfur everywhere. There are geothermal hot springs everywhere, and there are spa pools in the hotel rooms. In this area, the lake is gleaming, seagulls flock together, and the gray-yellow mud of the hot spring is boiling, which has become a tourist attraction. Geothermal activity has continued under and around the lake. Geothermal steam is constantly lingering around the lake, and the water is so high in sulphur that it creates a wonderful greenish-blue color. Walking along the lake shore, you can see the calm lake surrounded by rolling hills, with gentle curves that meet the sky. You can see large groups of black swans swimming gracefully in the lake everywhere, and countless rainbow trout swimming under the vast lake. If you can get up early and go to the lake to watch the sunrise, it is really beautiful. Facing the morning light, blue, red and gold are intertwined and sprinkled on the lake, which is very gorgeous. Accompanied by the shimmering light, various birds such as swans, wild ducks, and seagulls roamed the lake, and the quiet lake swayed in circles of ripples. If you go in winter, you will see a different scene. The grass is covered with frost, and the flowers are white, but the plants near the hot springs are smoky and green, as if a city has two seasons, one is winter and the other is spring. Stepping on the stone steps of the hot spring, holding a cup of water, it is warm and slippery. Rotorua's active volcanoes are very worth seeing. Active volcanic eruptions are staged every morning, which is a spectacle, and you have to be amazed by the power of nature. The volcanic mud is a major feature here. The black mud is bubbling and you can feel the heat just by looking at it. Lake cruises, sailing boats, kayaks, seaplanes, helicopters, jet boats... so many items. You can go on a sightseeing boat trip, or participate in various activities such as fishing trips and water cruises. In the middle of the lake is Mokoia Island, where countless water birds are parked. Once a Maori fortress, there is a great love story in New Zealand. There is a service desk in the park in front of the Novotel, where you can sign up to visit Mocuia. Take a dip in the hot springs at Waikemiah (now known as Heinemoa Springs) while looking out over the still-yet-old beauty of the lake. If you have enough time, a trip to the nearby Maori Cultural Village is also a good choice, just a 5-minute drive from downtown Rotorua. Besides enjoying Maori song and dance performances, Puhutu Geyser is also a spectacle not to be missed."

These green lights flicker on the black water, and the light and shadow are doubled. This is a wonderful world belonging to the green elves. 1. Three caves with different characteristics make up the Glowworm Cave The Glowworm Cave is mainly composed of three caves with different characteristics, Waitomo Glowworm Cave, Ruakuri Cave and Alanui Cave. The Glowworm Cave is a stalactite cave with a history of more than 10,000 years. There was a small ice-covered lake on the mountain of this cave. After the ice and snow melted, it flowed into the cracks in the rock formation below, and gradually eroded into the current cave. Cathedral Cave inside the Waitomo Glowworm Caves, this huge cave is known for its echoes of space. Ruakuri Cave is a legendary underground cave where the sound of water from an underground waterfall can be heard. The entrance of Alanui Cave is the visitor center, and the vaulted greenhouse with membrane structure is very imposing. 2. Thousands of glowworms enter the cave for a tour. You need to take a boat to enter the depths of the cave. After getting on the boat, the guide will pull the guide rope above to push the boat forward. The strange spot of light in the cave is the light emitted by thousands of fireflies. You will find patches of green and white light on the rocks. Looking closely, there are jagged translucent filaments hanging from the ceiling of the cave under the light and shadow. The silk has clear water droplets like a curtain of crystal beads. These beautiful filaments with slime are the firefly's fishing tool to attract and prey on light-following insects. This firefly has only been found in New Zealand and Australia. 3. Black Labyrinth Tour, Abyss Tour and Odyssey Tour In addition to the ""black water rafting"" in the Glowworm Cave, if you are brave enough and your endurance is good enough, you can also experience the Black Labyrinth Tour organized by the legendary black water rafting company , Journey to the Abyss and Journey to the Odyssey. These three journeys will take 3-5 hours respectively, and will involve rock climbing in caves, abseiling, and rafting on tires.

The origin of the Twelve Apostles Rock The Twelve Apostles Rock is actually a rock standing in the sea. It was originally a part of the coastline. After the erosion of waves and strong winds, it gradually broke away. Because these twelve stone pillars are reminiscent of the twelve apostles who followed Jesus Christ in the Bible, they are named ""Twelve Apostles"". Due to the continued alluvial action of the waves, only seven remain. 2. Gibson Steps There is a well-known step on the way to the Twelve Apostles, called Gibson Steps, which is excavated from the cliff. The steps are 100 meters long, with a total of 86 steps, and it takes about 15 minutes to go back and forth. Steps lead to the beach, but the waves here are rough, not suitable for swimming, but suitable for fishing. The width of the steps is about 1 meter, which is only enough for one person to pass, so tourists with limited mobility should not try it easily. At the end, you can see the endless blue sea and two huge stone pillars. The steps are about a 2-minute drive from the rock, and there is a parking lot nearby. The parking is very convenient. After getting off the car, visitors can go from the Twelve Apostles parking lot through the gravel walking trail to the Gibson Steps. The best time to photograph the Twelve Apostles is in the early morning and at dusk. It is even more shocking to take a helicopter to overlook it. In addition, you can also participate in sea fishing, golf, water sports and other projects here. 3. Although the Twelve Apostles Rock of London Bridge and Arch is the highlight of the Great Ocean Road, there are still many places to play along the Great Ocean Road. Attractions such as London Bridge and Arch are not far away and can be visited together. The arches are suitable for viewing in the afternoon, when the view is bathed in a warm golden sun. Co-located in Port Campbell National Park are the Shipwreck Coast and La Card Canyon, only a 10-minute drive from the Twelve Apostles. Due to the rugged terrain in this area, many shipwrecks have occurred here. The sand here is soft and the views are spectacular, perfect for photography. Arch Island is also nearby, but it collapsed in 2009, which shows the fragility of the coastline."

The street is about 3 kilometers long, starting from Auckland's waterfront in the north and ending at Karanga Heipi Road in the south. The main street was built in 1840 and named after Queen Victoria. Queen Street is Auckland's prime location, and you can't go wrong here if you want to shop. 1. Feel the various classical ornate buildings along the street. The buildings on both sides of Queen Street are a major attraction. The Edwardian Baroque-style Auckland Dock Building, the 19th-century Greek Revival-style Bank of New Zealand Building, the British Gothic-style building Patrick's Cathedral, the British colonial-style Auckland City Hall, the colonial historical buildings and modern high-rise buildings complement each other, conflicting and harmonious.

There is a bronze statue of a Maori warrior holding a wooden club on Queen Street, which is said to be out of respect for the Maori, because Auckland is a place where the Polynesians (the Maori are one of them) are very populated in the world. Smith & Caughey's department store is New Zealand's oldest and most beloved department store. 3.

It is located at the intersection of Queen St and Wellesley St. It is located at the corner of the street, and the facade is not large. The building has been restored and is grand and magnificent. It is mainly a venue for opera, musicals and theatre, and is also an important venue for the Auckland International Film Festival. Auckland City Hall is not far away, a typical neo-Baroque building. Not far from Queen Street is the iconic Sky Tower, which can be seen from Queen Street and not far from it. It is a dazzling sight in Auckland. 4. Christmas Parade Feel the festive atmosphere One of the biggest festivals on Queen Street is the annual Christmas Parade. The event is usually held in late November and early December. Visitors should try to arrive on both sides of Queen Street several hours in advance to occupy a position with a good view. The Christmas parade fully demonstrated the tolerant and multicultural society of New Zealand. There were typical English bands, as well as Chinese dragon dance, lion dance and waist drum teams. Major companies displayed their own floats, which were very lively."

It is the largest and longest coral group in the world. The Great Barrier Reef consists of more than 600 large and small coral reef islands, which are colorful and beautiful. The central coral reef island has become the iconic attraction of the Great Barrier Reef. 1. Attraction overview The Great Barrier Reef is home to a huge coral kingdom and thousands of marine life, as well as deep undersea cliffs, undersea tunnels and caves. Whether you are taking a helicopter to get a bird's-eye view of the corals or diving deep into the sea, you can truly appreciate it. Feel the magic of nature. When you come to the Great Barrier Reef, you can sign up for diving or semi-submersible ships to explore the underwater world. Of course, if you want to experience sailing out to sea, you can rent a variety of boats (from high-speed speedboats to catamarans) to ride the wind and waves and sail out to sea. You can also go on a cruise, depending on your time and preferences. If you want a more free sea experience, you can take a speedboat. In addition, overlooking the Great Barrier Reef by helicopter is also one of the projects not to be missed here, overlooking the world-famous Heart Reef from the air; riding a hot air balloon over the Atherton Tableland, the experience of going into the sea is not enough! 2. National Park There are many national parks near the Great Barrier Reef. In addition to the Daintree Rainforest (Daintree Rainforest), which is also a world natural heritage, there are many unmissable secret gardens waiting for you to slowly discover. Explore wildlife at Cape Tribulation and Nara Inlet on Hook Island, where rock art from the Ngaro people remains. Tourists can hire a professional guide to take you to the tropical rainforest, experience swimming, barbecue and other items in the national park. 3. Traveling methods To visit the Great Barrier Reef, you need to go to sea. Generally, you choose to start from Cairns or the Whitsundays. The Great Barrier Reef is mainly divided into the inner barrier reef and the outer barrier reef. The inner barrier reef is close to the city, and the outer barrier reef is far away from the city and has less pollution. Therefore, you must carefully choose the area you want to go according to your personal needs. 4.

Steep, jagged cliffs emerge from calm, dark waters, lush rainforest grows on the rock walls, and waterfalls plunge hundreds of meters into the sea. 1. The beautiful road in the world The road from Queenstown to the Fiordland is known as one of the most beautiful roads in the world. Along the way, it passes many scenic spots, such as Mirror Lake, trails, and Homer Tunnel. Many small waterfalls formed by melting snow. 2. Enjoy the scenery of the fjord by cruise ship The water tour of Milford Sound is the main way to enjoy the beauty of the fjord. After the sightseeing boat slowly leaves the pier of Milford Sound, you can see the The Baowen Waterfall is more than 100 meters high. When the wind is strong, the water of the waterfall will splash on the pier. On the opposite side of the waterfall is a small gravel pile called a small cemetery, which is the resting place of the whalers and sealers who lived nearby. Continue to drive forward, and on the left is the towering Matthew Peak, which stands directly on the sea. On the other side are Lion Mountain and Elephant Mountain, with very vivid names. Not far away is Tongjiao, which is the relatively channel of the fjord. When the wind is strong, it passes through the mountains, and the wind is amazing. When the boat comes to the Fairy Falls, the bow of the boat will meet directly below the waterfall, and the water of this waterfall is drinkable. After looking at the Tasman Sea from the boat, the boat will slowly turn around and re-enter the fjord, and a fjord cruise is basically complete. Airplane tours and sea kayaking tours are two other great ways to experience mountains, waterfalls, and sheer cliffs. There are also sightseeing boats with underwater viewing windows, allowing tourists to observe coral reefs and other marine landscapes from the bottom of the water. Dolphins, fjord penguins, seals and other aquatic creatures can also be seen in the fjord, especially in the seal headland where a large number of young seals often gather. 3.

Made entirely of rock blocks, this church is a classic postcard view of Lake Tekapo. At night, the church under the stars is even more beautiful, and it is also an excellent location for shooting star trails. 1. The appearance of the church is primitive and simple. Although it is not big, it has a unique flavor. The area of the church is only 20 to 30 square meters, which is very small. There is a small stone cross on the north roof, a small bell tower on the west side of the south roof, and a small bronze bell hangs in the arched wall hole. The outer wall of the entire church is a random combination of the original dark gray, light gray, cyan and brown of the rock, while the roof is a black stone piece. Such a primitive and rustic appearance makes it special in this open lakeside wilderness. Harmony and harmony. Although the church is small, it is very famous. During the day, there will be buses with tour groups arriving one after another. At night, you often encounter people who bring professional photography equipment to take pictures of the stars. Walking into the church, there are five or six rows of benches on the left and right sides. From the middle aisle to the pulpit by the window, a cross ten centimeters high stands in front of the glass window, against the light, outside the window is the blue sky and white clouds and the lake water. Great view, with views of Mount Cook in the distance. 2. Bronze statue of a shepherd dog next to the church A towering bronze statue of a shepherd dog can be seen not far from the church. It is used to commemorate the contribution made by the shepherd dog to protecting the flock. The statue is also engraved with ""No Shepherd"". Dogs, there would be no small town today"" and other words. 3. Look up at the starry sky and watch the unique astronomical scene. If you plan to go here in the middle of the night, you need to check whether the weather is fine in advance. When you lie on a bench by the lake and look up at the stars, you can see unique astronomical sights that can only be seen in the southern hemisphere, such as the Southern Cross constellation, the Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way satellite galaxies, etc. If you are lucky, you can even see meteors passing by night sky. With the exception of the Church of the Good Shepherd, the entire Lake Tekapo area is a good spot for stargazing as long as you stay away from street lights. Of course, if the budget is sufficient, you can also sign up for the stargazing cluster on Mount John."

You need to take a boat to enter the depths of the cave. After getting on the boat, the guide will pull the guide rope above to push the boat forward. The strange spot of light in the cave is the light emitted by thousands of fireflies. You will find patches of green and white light on the rocks. Looking closely, there are jagged translucent filaments hanging from the ceiling of the cave under the light and shadow. The silk has clear water droplets like a curtain of crystal beads. These beautiful filaments with slime are the firefly's fishing tool to attract and prey on light-following insects. This firefly has only been found in New Zealand and Australia. 3. Black Labyrinth Tour, Abyss Tour and Odyssey Tour In addition to the ""black water rafting"" in the Glowworm Cave, if you are brave enough and your endurance is good enough, you can also experience the Black Labyrinth Tour organized by the legendary black water rafting company , Journey to the Abyss and Journey to the Odyssey. These three journeys will take 3-5 hours respectively, and will involve rock climbing in caves, abseiling, and rafting on tires. Of course, if you participate in these tours, you can not only enjoy free hot showers, but also delicious hot soup and local New Zealand pancakes for you to enjoy. Plus, get a free visit to the Waitomo Caves Museum."

It is very wide. ""Iguazu"" means ""huge water"" in the language of the Guarani people, the indigenous people of South America. The waterfall is located on the border between Argentina and Brazil. In 1984, Iguazu Falls was listed as a World Natural Heritage by UNESCO. The difference between Iguazu Falls is that there are many viewing points. From different locations, different directions, and different heights, you can see different scenes. The entire waterfall group is numerous, majestic and powerful, which is unforgettable for a lifetime. 1. The history of the waterfall In 1542, a Spanish missionary accidentally discovered the Iguazu Falls in the tropical rain forest of the Parana River Basin in South America. The rumbling sound of the waterfall spread dozens of kilometers away. The fact that Iguazu can form such a spectacular waterfall here is inseparable from its geological and geographical conditions. Magma erupted 1.2 billion years ago to form the current terrain. The Paraná River Valley in Brazil is a north-south basalt. The Iguazu River and its riverbed rock formations are just perpendicular to the Paraná River, and the scouring and erosion of the river water is far weaker than that of the Paraná River. Day after day, the level difference of the riverbed is formed at the confluence of the Iguazu River and the Paraná River. After countless days and nights, the majestic Iguazu Falls have formed such a majestic appearance . Until now, the Great Falls are still changing, and will continue to do so. The formation of a basalt highland at the beginning can not help but make people feel full of emotion. 2. A detailed introduction to the waterfall The Iguazu River originates from the Mar Mountains near Curitiba, and flows westward through the Brazilian plateau for 1,320 kilometers before joining the Paraná River. There are as many as 30 large and small rivers along the way. Flowing to the Iguazu Falls, the river widened to 4 kilometers. The Iguazu River runs thousands of miles to the border between the two countries. When it falls steeply from the basalt cliff to the Paraná River Gorge, the river is divided into 275 large and small waterfalls by the rocks and dense trees at the fault, falling into an average The semi-circular waterfall group with a drop of 72 meters. Due to the large amount of water in the river, it converges into a majestic waterfall here, and its water flow reaches 1,700 cubic meters per second. The power, shape and loud noise of Iguazu Falls will only be believed if you experience it for yourself, and the countless bizarre rainbows formed under the reflection of the sun are spectacular. Iguazu Falls far exceeds Niagara Falls in North America in terms of height and width, and the scenery is more majestic. The sound of its waterfalls can be heard 30 kilometers away, which is a wonder on earth. Iguazu Falls is located in the subtropical zone, and the water volume does not change much throughout the year. From January to March, it is the local rainy season, and the flow of the waterfall is large, which is a good viewing season. From August to October, it is the dry season, and the flow of the waterfall is small. 3. The water flow is large and violent. The main part of the river falls from a narrow semi-circular fissure. The scene is described as ""the sea pouring into the abyss"". This section can be seen on both sides of Brazil and Argentina. During the flood season, the width is 3.5 to 4 kilometers, and the drop is 60 to 82 meters. The thunder-like falling sound is 25 kilometers away from the surrounding area, and the splashing fog is like a bead curtain. There is a feeling. 4. Excursion project in the park A few years ago, the Iguazu Falls tourist area was operated by a private company. This company built a tourist plank road about 20 kilometers long, laid electric railways, and the tourist facilities took a new look. In the scenic spot, you can walk along the trestle bridge, or take a tour bus to visit various scenic spots. Intimate contact with the waterfall is a more exciting activity in Foz do Iguaçu - rushing into the waterfall by speedboat, shuttle under the waterfall, very exciting and pleasant. However, this is a self-funded project, the cost is 60 US dollars once, and you need to go downstream first. First, take a sightseeing bus through the jungle (it is said that the seeds of a tree on both sides are specially used for making perfume in France, and some plants are the staple food of the Indians), and then take a jeep down a few particularly steep slopes after disembarking. To the shore speedboat departure point. Visitors need raincoats and life jackets on board the speedboat. The boat is upstream, the speed is relatively fast, and the current is also fast. This is repeated several times, which is very exciting. 5. Differences between Argentina and Brazil The waterfalls are distributed on both sides of the canyon. Argentina and Brazil are bounded by this canyon, and the waterfalls viewed in Argentina and Brazil are also very different. Brazil and Argentina have built national parks on the north and south sides of the waterfall. The Argentine National Park covers an area of 65,000 hectares. In 1975, a green railing bridge was built upstream of the waterfall. to the edge of the waterfall. The park on the Brazilian side is the largest forest reserve in Brazil, with an area of 170,000 hectares, and there are many wild animals in the park.The momentum of rolling down. On the Brazilian side there is a panoramic view of the main waterfalls on the Argentine side."

The craftsmen formed 15 guilds, which in 1501 carried out the decision of the municipal council to join the Swiss Confederation. To commemorate this event, at the beginning of the 16th century, the first half of the then town hall was replaced by a very famous new building. The battlements have also been renovated, surrounded by very rich colors, with 12 badges hanging, representing the 12 cantons, including Basel, which joined the Swiss Confederation at the time. At the beginning of the 17th century, the town hall was enlarged, and HansBock painted the wider and longer walls, with imitation architecture.

At the same time, the original rear building built in the 14th century was demolished and a new building was built.

The wine cellar, the choir, the tomb of Erasmus in Rotterdam, the Galluspforte and the two cloisters bear witness to the vicissitudes of the cathedral over the centuries. Basel's history as an urban settlement begins in Chapel Hill. In the first century BC, Celts from the Rauricii tribe lived in the fortified ""oppidum"". Today, the remains of the ""Celtic Wall"" can still be seen in the semi-underground windows of the Rittergasse. In 15 BC, the Roman army established a military base on Chapel Hill on the border between the Roman Empire and the Germanic tribes. In the center of the Münsterplatz square, you can see a hidden Roman well leading to the groundwater of the Rhine. In the late Roman Empire, Christianity was established in the Basel area. Existing documents record bishops who came to Basel from the Roman republic of Augusta Raurica, located about 10 kilometers upstream of the Rhine. But in fact, the names of all the bishops who have lived in Basel since the 8th century are now known. The cathedral dates back to the reign of Charlemagne, and the building was destroyed in 917 when the Hungarians attacked the entire city. At the beginning of the 11th century, Henry II built a magnificent new church for Basel. During the 25 years at the end of the 12th century, the church of Henry's period was replaced by Romanesque buildings, and after the earthquake in 1356, it was renovated into a Gothic church. Around the Münsterplatz square, the priests of the church built their own post-Gothic residences, and the open space was used for commemorative processions, festivals, competitions and grand military parades for visiting people. In 1529, Basel became fully Protestant. Bishops and clergy left the city, and the clergy's empty homes were sold to wealthy merchants. In the 18th century, the church became post-Baroque and Neoclassical, while Münsterplatz became a quiet and prosperous residential area, and later the administrative center of Basel. Today, this magnificent square is used as a venue for various events and an open space for people to meet."

In the 12th century, it became the residence of the Italian Savoy family, in 1536. After being administered by the Swiss in Bern, it was used as an official residence and armory.

More than 200 prisoners were imprisoned that year. In 1532, the abbot of St. Victor Abbey in Geneva, Boniwain, advocated the independence of Geneva, and was chained to the stone pillar for four years until March 29, 1536 in Switzerland. After the people captured the castle, they released him. In 1816, when the British poet Byron visited Chillon Castle, he heard about this tragic history, so he left his signature on the stone pillar and wrote ""The Prisoner of Chillon"". There are many magnificent halls in the castle. They were once the place where the Safoy family feasted, and now they are also used to undertake various banquets, dances and birthday parties. The windows of all the halls face Lake Geneva, and the windows open to the charming scenery composed of Lake Geneva and the surrounding mountains.
