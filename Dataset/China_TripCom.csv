There were more than a thousand terracotta soldiers unearthed here, each with a different facial expression. Standing before the massive underground army, you will feel the extraordinary might of the Qin Emperor that enabled him to unify six warring states two thousand years ago. The Qin Emperor Ying Zheng began building the mausoleum for himself at the age of 13. Nearly 720000 men and 38 years were required to complete this vast project."

Shanghai Disney Resort9.94.7/5231.6k Reviewsbased on 2.3k reviewNo. 1 of Top Best Things to Do in ShanghaiTheme ParksAnonymous UserThe only purpose of coming to Shanghai is Disney. Sure enough, I am really happy. On my birthday, I went in and got a birthday card. Most of the staff will also tell you that I am happy birthday. Everything else gives me a good feeling except that the weather is not 10 points refreshing. Queuing time is not very long. It takes only five to 10 minutes for each game to last only 20 minutes, and finally pick the day in. Maybe because of Monday, watching fireworks is also beautiful, but there will be lampposts blocking if you can't find the best location. The only pity is that I just found out that I can't visit the animal metropolis that will open until December 20th. I am really disappointed.Ready to Use ImmediatelyAvailable TodayChina · ShanghaiSave RM 10.44RM 270.77From RM 260.33",https://my.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/shanghai/shanghai-disney-resort-13412802/?locale=en-MY&curr=MYR,,,China,Shanghai Disney Resort,"As the first Disney resort in mainland China, Shanghai Disney Resort is a world-class family entertainment destination.

The Forbidden City, known as Gugong in Mandarin, once served as the imperial palace for 24 emperors during the Ming and Qing dynasties. It is a symbol of ancient China. Although it is no longer China's political centre, you can still feel its former glory once you are within the courtyard and surrounded by the high walls. Its long history has left behind a large amount of precious architecture and cultural relics, making it one of the most important cultural heritage in modern China."
