There are now 25 towers left without counting the hundreds of bell towers in the city.The taller one of the pair is called the Asinelli while the smaller but more leaning tower is called the Garisenda. Their names derive from the families which are traditionally credited with constructing them between 1109 and 1119.The Asinelli Tower was used by the scientists Giovanni Battista Riccioli (in 1640) and Giovanni BattistaGuglielmini (in the following century) for experiments to study the motion of heavy bodies and the earth rotation. Bologna’s towers were cited several times by Dante in the Divine Comedy and The Rhymes (a confirmation of his stay in Bologna), and by Goethe in his Italian Journey. The Two Towers have also been the subject of an eponymous poem by Giosuè Carducci as part of the Barbarian Odes. Charles Dickens wrote about the towers in his Pictures from Italy.In World War II, between 1943 and 1945, it was used as a sight post: during bombing attacks, four volunteers took post at the top to direct rescue operations to places hit by Allied bombs.Later, a RAI television relay was installed on top.Architect Minor Yamasaki is thought to have been inspired by the Towers when designing the World Trade Center during the 1960s.Italy · Metropolitan City of Bologna",https://my.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/bologna/two-towers-18696085/?locale=en-MY&curr=MYR,7,https://my.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/italy-100026/tourist-attractions/7.html/,Two Towers,"The twin towers, one high and the other low, are the iconic buildings of Bologna.

In the center of the square is the obelisk that Caligula brought back to Rome from Heliopolis. There are two fountains on both sides of the Piazza Fountain. The one on the right was built by Maderno in the 17th century, and the one on the left was a replica designed and later repaired by Bernini.

There were a total of 21 triumphal arches in ancient Rome, but today there are only three remaining in the city of Rome. The Arc de Triomphe of Constantine is one of them, and the other two are located in the Roman Forum. Overview of the Arc de Triomphe Located on the west side of the Colosseum, the Arc de Triomphe of Constantine is 25.7 meters long, 7.4 meters wide, and 21 meters high. It has 3 arches. But still in the wind and rain, witnessing the glory of Rome together with the Colosseum. Today, the Arc de Triomphe has become a must-see attraction for tourists visiting Rome. Arc de Triomphe relief panels The eight relief panels above the Arc de Triomphe were dismantled from the monument to Emperor Aurelius at that time, and the originals are now kept in the Museum of the Roman Capital. The main content is the life performance of successive emperors, such as Antony, Hadrian and so on. Only the circular reliefs above the two small arches depict scenes of this war. Today and the eve of the Arc de Triomphe, Napoleon came to Rome, saw this Arc de Triomphe, and greatly appreciated it, and then built the Arc de Triomphe in Paris based on it. Therefore, although the Arc de Triomphe of Constantine is the later built of the three triumphal arches in Rome, the shadow of early Roman art can still be seen, and it is well preserved and worth a visit."

The Doge's Palace was originally a Byzantine-style defensive castle, and the huge expenditure when it was established showed the power and wealth of the Republic of Venice at that time. Architectural Style The present building was mainly constructed between 1309 and 1424. In 1574, the Governor's Palace was severely damaged by a fire. Although the designers of the time submitted designs in the neoclassical style, subsequent reconstructions continued the original Gothic style. However, there are also some classicist features, such as the Bridge of Sighs, built since the 16th century, through which the Doge's Palace is connected to the prison. Today, the Doge's Palace is a museum where visitors can admire paintings of Venice depicted by Tintoretto and Veronese. The Governor's Palace, which has a ㄇ-shaped internal structure, is divided into three floors, and the two sides facing the square and the wharf are its main walls. In a geometric pattern of white and rose marble, a solid wall is placed on the third floor, with A-line lace interspersed with gothic flame-shaped minarets on the upper edge. The second floor is a Gothic pointed-vault loggia decorated with four-leaf ornaments, and the Gothic arcade on the lower floor is supported by columns to support the two arches on the second floor. This not only subtly breaks the traditional Gothic design, but also subverts the traditional architectural principles to overcome the problem of the top heavy and the bottom light. It retains the original Byzantine concept and integrates the Gothic design to become a light and slender masterpiece of Venetian Gothic architecture. . Buy a ticket from the ticket entrance on the Slavic Embankment. There is a simple map behind the ticket, indicating the location of the Doge's Palace, St. Mark's Basilica and the adjacent Craft Museum. Many original sculptures from the Doge's Palace are displayed in the Craft Museum. After entering the exhibition hall, you first come to the atrium, which is characterized by Renaissance-style marble carvings. Here you can see the ""onion head"" dome of the adjoining St. Mark's Basilica, with a clock-shaped marble facade on it. The first floor of the cloister on the three sides of the courtyard is a Renaissance-style regular round arch, and the second floor is a Gothic pointed arch, which is different from the Gothic pointed arch in the facade of the Governor's Palace. On the promenade on the second floor, there are several lion mouths in the shape of a lion's head, which are used to receive anonymous reporting letters. The public only needs to put the letter into the mouth of the lion. At that time, the Venice government encouraged whistleblowers and protected whistleblowers. Three locks were specially set up in the mailbox, which must be opened by three persons with three keys. In addition, standing on the sky balcony of the promenade on the second floor, you can overlook St. Mark's Square and the lagoon. There are 8 statues from the ancient Greek period in the courtyard. There are two finely carved bronze water wells on the ground in the courtyard, which are considered to be exquisite works of Venice in the 16th century. This well can absorb water from the outside waterway to the atrium for storage. In the past, it was the best quality water in Venice. Every day, many traders came to the Doge's Palace to fetch water, and then took the well water to distant areas to sell it. Then came to the official starting point of the tour route - the golden stairs, from which you entered the interior of the Governor's Palace. At the entrance of the golden staircase arch, the Hercules on the left is Hercules slaying the snake demon, and the god Atlas on the right is carrying the earth. They are above the stone pillars on the two sides of the entrance to represent the power of Venice symbol of. The golden stairs built in the 16th century were only used by nobles and important guests to enter the palace. The stairs can be said to be resplendent, and the ceiling carvings on the top are actually made of plaster and then decorated with a layer of gold foil. Follow the golden stairs to the third floor of the Governor's Palace. Every room here is as luxurious as possible. From the ceiling to the surrounding walls, there are magnificent decorations everywhere. However, according to the regulations here, photography is not allowed above the second floor. The main halls of the Governor's Mansion include the Map Hall, the Four Entrance Halls, the Conference Hall, the Ten-person Hall, the Elder Hall and the Grand Conference Hall. The walls of the map hall are decorated with world maps, and two huge globes are kept inside. In the conference hall, there is Tintoretto's giant mural ""Paradise"", which is based on Dante's ""The Divine Comedy"". There are more than 700 figures in the painting, which is called the world's largest oil painting. After visiting the various halls, go to the armory displaying various weapons, guns, ammunition and armor, which preserves the weapons of the Crusades, the first machine gun imitated according to Da Vinci's design, and the shocking chastity belt . Then the passage becomes dark and you will come to the cell located in the basement of the Doge's Palace. The number of prison cells at that time was not enough, so a new prison was built next to the palace, which became an independent building for the purpose of imprisoning prisoners in history, and the Bridge of Sighs connecting the two places was also built."

It was selected as a world cultural heritage by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is actually an independent bell tower of the Cathedral of Pisa, located in the central square of Pisa, the Miracle Square. The square is full of people, and it is common for tourists to stretch out their arms and pose for pictures with the Leaning Tower in all kinds of whimsical shapes. Leaning Tower Construction History and Leaning Reasons The Leaning Tower of Pisa is more than 20 meters away from the cathedral. It has a cylindrical appearance and is made of white marble. The year of construction engraved in Latin on the base of the tower was 1174, and it was completed in 1350; but in fact, the calendar used in ancient Pisa was one year earlier than the Gregorian calendar, so the year of construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was 1173. It is said that the Leaning Tower of Pisa was built with six trophies brought in by the Pisa fleet. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is 54.5 meters high and 16 meters in diameter. In the early stages of construction, the leaning tower tilted an average of 1 mm per year, and construction was temporarily suspended. Most believe the slope is due to uneven foundations and soft soil layers. In 1998, workers wrapped cables on the third tier, attached it to the frame, and removed some of the deposited soil to the north to bring the leaning tower into equilibrium. There are 213 arches on each floor of the leaning tower overlooking the city of Pisa. There are 294 spiral steps in the tower, for tourists to climb the tower and overlook the scenery of the whole city. Some steps are slippery, so you need to pay attention to your feet. In summer evenings, you can enjoy the beautiful night view of Pisa from the Leaning Tower. The experience of entering the Leaning Tower is very special. When you walk down the very narrow spiral staircase, you will feel as if you are on a boat. When you reach the top of the tower, the vision is suddenly clear. There is glass at the top of the tower, because the interior of the tower is hollow, so the ground floor can be seen directly through the glass. The process of climbing the tower is now limited by time and number of people. You need to go to the ticket office to book tickets in advance, or if you want to avoid long queues, you can buy tickets on the official website and print them out. Ticket holders to the summit should gather at the designated place in advance. The staff will first introduce the history of the Leaning Tower for 5 minutes, and then a special person will lead the team to climb the tower. Only 15 people are arranged in each batch, and the stay on the tower shall not exceed 30 minutes. If you feel that the Leaning Tower is too expensive, you can walk around the Leaning Tower, or visit the churches and museums on the square. There are many pedestrian streets near the scenic spot, and various handicrafts are sold in small shops."

The designer made a boat that was half-submerged in the pool outside the original fountain. The water from the fountain first flows into the broken ship, and then slowly overflows from the four sides of the ship. In addition, the entire fountain is almost as high as the street level, and it really feels like a leaking ship is about to sink into the ground. In ""Roman Holiday"", Hepburn is sitting on the steps next to the fountain, eating ice cream. Many tourists stand at the fountain and take their cameras up to take pictures, so that they can take a panoramic view of the Spanish Steps and the Holy Trinity Church.

The Pantheon is located in the center of Rome. Its vestibule is Piazza Rotonda. There is a fountain erected with a tall steeple stele. The base of the stele is carved with scenes from ancient Roman mythology. The main building structure is simple and clear. It is a huge cylinder of equal width and height, covered with a semi-circular dome. There are no windows inside, and there are statues of gods all around. There is a large circular hole with a diameter of 8.9 meters on the top, which is the lighting point of the Pantheon. The light leaks from the top and changes the angle of the light with the movement of the position of the sun, giving people a sacred and solemn feeling."

It was a place where gladiators fought for their lives, prisoners fought with hungry lions, and a great symbol of eternal Rome. Colosseum History The Colosseum was built on the original site of the splendid DumusAurea and was completed in AD 80. But with the decline of the Roman Empire in the 6th century AD, the Colosseum was gradually abandoned and overgrown. In the following years, the Colosseum was damaged by earthquakes many times, and it even became a source of stone and marble for builders. The Colosseum that is now presented to people has only the incomplete skeleton, but it can still glimpse the style of the day. From the outside, the Colosseum has four floors (including the underground), and only part of the ground floor and the second floor are currently open. On the first floor, you can clearly see the labyrinth-like buildings in the center of the Colosseum. The basements that used to be the Colosseum housed the beasts and gladiators who were going to duel. If you want to see the underground part up close, you need to be led by a guide. visit. The entire outer wall of the Colosseum is made of limestone, and each floor has 80 arches (vormitori), which can allow spectators to enter and take their seats quickly. The depressions on the second and third floors were once filled with marble statues. The top of the wall is dotted with windows and slender Corinthian pilasters, and there are 240 pilasters to support the canvas canopy that covers the Colosseum. These canvas canopies, which shield the audience from the scorching sun and sun, are now invisible. On the second floor, you can clearly see the internal structure of the entire Colosseum. You can clearly see that the entire interior of the Colosseum is divided into three parts: the arena, the auditorium and the podium. The arena had a sand-covered wooden floor to prevent the gladiators from falling and to absorb the blood that shed. The arena can also be flooded with water for simulated naval battles. The traps on the field lead to the basement and the tunnel below the arena. Animals in cages awaiting combat are lifted by a pulley mechanism and transported into the arena. The audience seats (cavea) are divided into three levels: the knights sit on the lower level, the wealthy citizens sit in the middle, and the commoners sit on the upper level. The slope in the stands is very large, so that the audience in each stand can clearly see the performance. The steps are relatively steep, so pay attention to safety when visiting. The passageway inside the stands is wide enough for two cars to be driven side by side. The podium is a wide terrace between the auditorium and the arena, reserved for monarchs, parliamentarians and important personalities. Most of the third and fourth floors of the Colosseum have collapsed, and the upper walls are decorated with small windows. Don't rush out at the end of the visit. There is a museum on the second floor of the Colosseum, which displays some of the statues and replicas preserved in the Colosseum. In addition, you can also see the restored model of the Colosseum, and you want to know more about it. Don't miss out on the history of the Colosseum. Viewing at night, the Colosseum under different lights of the day shows different tones, which is very beautiful. At present, night lights are installed in the Colosseum, which makes the Colosseum at night extraordinarily beautiful. Friends who like photography should not Forget about shooting at night. You can also choose to visit the Colosseum at night with a guided tour. Opposite the Colosseum is Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum. You can also visit if you are interested."

It is a landmark building in Milan. It was built in 1387 and took 500 years to complete. Architectural features There are 135 large and small spires in the church, each of which has a statue. Sculpture and spires are one of the characteristics of Gothic architecture. The Milan Cathedral expresses this feature vividly, so it is also one of the most statues in the world. There are more than 6,000 marble statues in the Gothic church. When you walk into the church, you will feel that the exterior of the church is gorgeous, the interior is simple, and the light here is relatively dim. The hall is long, narrow, and very high, giving a very spacious feel, with the vaults reaching a height of 45 meters above the ground. The floor of the hall is colorful floor tiles, which have remained bright for hundreds of years. There are towering stone pillars on both sides of the hall and gorgeous flower windows. The flower windows here are the largest in the world, mainly based on the story of Jesus. The flower window has gone through 500 years and is still dazzling. In the east of the church, there are also three annular lattice windows, which are the boutiques in the church window. After climbing to the top to visit the church, after going out, there is a small door there, buy a ticket to the top of the church to see it, the roof is not to be missed. There are two types of fares for climbing to the top, one is to take the elevator to the top, the other is to walk to the top by yourself, but if you take the elevator to the top, the elevator is also two-thirds of the height of the church, and you still need to walk by yourself. go up. There is a reminder at the ticket office that there are only more than 200 steps to the top on foot. Walk to the platform level on the top floor (you can also take the elevator here). From the platform level, you need to walk a section of outdoor corridor before continuing to the top. On the platform level, you can see the exquisite spires on the top of the church and the statues on the spires. The statues have different shapes, including characters and animals, which are very lifelike. On the platform level, you can also overlook the gilded statue of the Virgin Mary on the spire of the church, which is very beautiful. Stepping on the ridge of the church and continuing up to the roof, the scene here is even more shocking than looking up at the bottom. The roof is so distinctive that the landscape seen is enough to be a symbol of the Milan Cathedral. On the roof, it is not only the beauty of Milan that makes you dizzy, but also the 135 beautiful stalagmite-shaped spires on the roof, which seem to build a fairy tale world around you. And the statues on the spire are the same size as life, and I can't help but sigh that the Milan Cathedral is a treasure in the history of human architecture."
