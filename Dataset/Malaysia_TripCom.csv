Walking through the bridge and entering the artificial island, you can see a big unfinished hotel. The merchants on the ground floor of the building are also closed, so there will be some desolation and a little terror along the way.

The central area of worship cannot be visited, but you can detour from both sides to the side of the mosque by the sea. This mosque is not as big as the Blue Mosque in Kuala Lumpur, but it is still very popular to take pictures. Give some suggestions: 1. On the left side of the mosque, you can take pictures of the mosque that extends to the sea. 2. On the side of the mosque sea, you can also take a few pictures. 3.

About 5 years ago, Ernest Zacharevic, a Lithuanian artist, came to the century-old street in Penang. At first, it was just an unintentional backpacking trip, but he did not expect it to become his creative base, and even more unexpectedly gave Penang Old Street different from the vitality of the past. His mural is a work of art from MirrorsGeorgetown. In 2012, in order to coincide with Penang's celebration of the 4th anniversary of George Town's entry into the World Cultural Heritage, the Penang Arts Council listed ""George Town Mirror"" as one of the celebration activities. Officially, because of such a celebration, so many works of life are displayed in front of us. Penang's murals are scattered in the streets and alleys of George Town, and you can see it when you walk around the streets. According to the map, you can connect some scenic spots and murals to design a reasonable play route. If you don’t have enough time, you can also choose to ride a bicycle or take a human-powered tricycle. The cost of renting a bicycle is about 70 yuan a day, and the cost of a tricycle is 40 ringgit an hour. The advantage of the rickshaw is that the drivers are all locals, who are relatively familiar with these murals, and it saves time to play. Tour Guide Whether it is from the Everbright Building, Surname Bridge or Love Lane, it is a good sightseeing route. At present, there are more than 20 murals and 52 iron sculpture cartoons in George Town, which are distributed on the streets of LebuhChulia, LebuhAhQuee, LebuhVictoria and LebuhArmenian. Ernest Zacharevic has 8 murals here. ""Photo with the Old Man"" on LebuhArmenian Street, this is his first work, the fresco has begun to fade due to the age. There is also a well-known copy of ""Sister and Brother Riding Together"" on this street. In the picture, an older sister who is not very skilled in driving takes her excited and nervous younger brother on a bicycle and does not know where to go. Many tourists will put out the action of pushing the back seat of the bicycle, or the action of actually riding the bicycle behind them, which is very interesting. In addition, several well-known works are ""Broken Heart"" by Love Lane, ""Kung Fu Girl"" by LebuhMuntri, ""The Boy Who Chased the Wind"" by LebuhAhQuee Street, and ""The Resting Tricycle Driver"" by PenangRoad Wait. Today, in addition to the original murals, Chinese painter Chen Yukang has created many art works about cats together with the ""101 Lost Cats"" organization. In addition, Penang also has a ""Sign George Town Project"", which uses comic-style iron sculpture murals to tell the legends of the old street or the life of the citizens. A total of 52 iron plastic cartoons for the ""Sign George Town Project"" are the works of SculptureAtWork, a local art group that won the ""Sign George Town Project"" competition. As long as you walk on the streets of Penang, you will always find many vivid and interesting cartoons, which will add some childishness to the nostalgic Penang."

There are several good restaurants around the lake. The taste is delicious and the price is very reasonable. You can try it. The main purpose of tourists coming to Dongfang Village is to take the aerial cable car in the park. It is the longest and one of the most advanced cable cars in the world. It can climb from the flat to the top of the mountain more than 700 meters high. You can buy lift tickets through the official website or the ticket window of the scenic spot. The cable car can't bring bottled water in, and there are many people in line. The cable car has two stations, the first station can not go down, take the cable car all the way to the top of the mountain. The mountain wind is very strong, the cable car is swaying all the way, and the cable car and flyover are not open when it is raining or the weather is bad.

When the weather is good, the dense woods under your feet are clearly visible, and when the fog is foggy, you feel like you are in a fairyland. However, because the mountain wind is relatively strong, there will still be a feeling of shaking when walking. It is recommended that people who are timid and afraid of heights should not try it lightly. The mid-level sky shop can also send postcards, but the price is quite expensive. In addition to the cable car, there are many recreational facilities in Dongfang Village, such as 3D museum, watching 6D movies, driving mountain buggies and other activities.

Three-quarters of the entire mosque is built on Lake Brat, also known as the Water Mosque. It's visually stunning thanks to its pink dome topped with granite. The construction of the mosque started in 1997 at a huge cost and can accommodate 15,000 people. The exterior is all pink, quite soft in color, and built with a lot of rose marble. The mosque has nine domes and can reach a height of 50 meters. Standing on Prince Edward Square is a good spot to photograph the exterior of the mosque. Between the blue sky, white clouds and clear water, the pink sanctuary is so beautiful that you can't take your eyes off it. It is not like the Forbidden City in Beijing, as red as a red flame rose. This mosque is more like a pink holy lotus blooming on the water, with a clear rhythm and a pure dream. The mosque is mainly composed of three parts: the prayer hall, the big minaret and the mausoleum. The roof of the hall looks like an open umbrella. It consists of 49 large and small round arches with 18 radiating stars, representing the 13 states of the country and the five commandments of Islam. The shape of the spire of the big minaret is like a rocket, the whole tower is 73 meters high, and there are elevators and stairs leading to the upper end. The mausoleum is built behind the mosque, where only the national heroes of Islam are buried. Most of the people who came to the mosque were tour groups from China and India. Because of time constraints, most of these tour groups just took pictures on the outside. If you are an independent tourist, you can visit it if you have enough time, because the interior of the mosque is actually more magnificent than the dreamy appearance. There is a red sign at the entrance of the mosque that says that non-Muslims, women who are menstruating and children under the age of five are not allowed to enter the prayer hall. All visitors must be properly dressed and not revealing when entering. Quiet loud noises in the temple, no smoking. Therefore, whether it is a boy or a girl, you can get a red or blue robe for free at the entrance, wear it on your body, and wear a hat at the same time. Girls can't show their hair, and there will be staff reminding them all the time. In addition, the shoes must also be taken off, you can put them on the rack specially for shoes, just remember where you put them. After entering, there will be a staff member who will explain it for free. Photography is prohibited in the prayer hall, please strictly abide by it. There are no idols in the temple, because Muslims do their prayers in the direction of Mecca. The mosque is divided into two floors, the second floor can be used exclusively by 4,000 women, and the downstairs can be used by 8,000 men. Muslims will worship at a certain time every day. At this time, the sound of the Koran played in the high minaret of the mosque lingers melodiously in the sky above the mosque, which is very pleasant. The design of the mosque is quite environmentally friendly. The prayer hall is very spacious. There are 12 pillars in it. The center of the pillars is a vacuum design. When the weather is hot, the motor at the bottom of the lake can be pumped into the interior, so it will feel slightly cool when entering the mosque. In addition, you can also see some Koran decorations in the temple, and there is a yellow explanatory diagram on the wall, telling people the correct mode of worship. In addition, the mosque has an auditorium with a capacity of 380 people and two classrooms, where lectures and lectures can be held.

I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone! Don't miss this gem when you're in Malaysia; it's a heartwarming memory waiting to be made.Malaysia · PutrajayaFree","https://my.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/putrajaya/putra-mosque-98287/","","","Putra Mosque","The Pink Mosque is located in Putrajaya, the new administrative center of Malaysia. Three-quarters of the entire mosque is built on Lake Brat, also known as the Water Mosque. It's visually stunning thanks to its pink dome topped with granite. The construction of the mosque started in 1997 at a huge cost and can accommodate 15,000 people. The exterior is all pink, quite soft in color, and built with a lot of rose marble. The mosque has nine domes and can reach a height of 50 meters. Standing on Prince Edward Square is a good spot to photograph the exterior of the mosque. Between the blue sky, white clouds and clear water, the pink sanctuary is so beautiful that you can't take your eyes off it. It is not like the Forbidden City in Beijing, as red as a red flame rose. This mosque is more like a pink holy lotus blooming on the water, with a clear rhythm and a pure dream. The mosque is mainly composed of three parts: the prayer hall, the big minaret and the mausoleum. The roof of the hall looks like an open umbrella. It consists of 49 large and small round arches with 18 radiating stars, representing the 13 states of the country and the five commandments of Islam. The shape of the spire of the big minaret is like a rocket, the whole tower is 73 meters high, and there are elevators and stairs leading to the upper end. The mausoleum is built behind the mosque, where only the national heroes of Islam are buried. Most of the people who came to the mosque were tour groups from China and India. Because of time constraints, most of these tour groups just took pictures on the outside. If you are an independent tourist, you can visit it if you have enough time, because the interior of the mosque is actually more magnificent than the dreamy appearance. There is a red sign at the entrance of the mosque that says that non-Muslims, women who are menstruating and children under the age of five are not allowed to enter the prayer hall. All visitors must be properly dressed and not revealing when entering. Quiet loud noises in the temple, no smoking. Therefore, whether it is a boy or a girl, you can get a red or blue robe for free at the entrance, wear it on your body, and wear a hat at the same time. Girls can't show their hair, and there will be staff reminding them all the time. In addition, the shoes must also be taken off, you can put them on the rack specially for shoes, just remember where you put them. After entering, there will be a staff member who will explain it for free. Photography is prohibited in the prayer hall, please strictly abide by it. There are no idols in the temple, because Muslims do their prayers in the direction of Mecca. The mosque is divided into two floors, the second floor can be used exclusively by 4,000 women, and the downstairs can be used by 8,000 men. Muslims will worship at a certain time every day. At this time, the sound of the Koran played in the high minaret of the mosque lingers melodiously in the sky above the mosque, which is very pleasant. The design of the mosque is quite environmentally friendly. The prayer hall is very spacious. There are 12 pillars in it. The center of the pillars is a vacuum design. When the weather is hot, the motor at the bottom of the lake can be pumped into the interior, so it will feel slightly cool when entering the mosque. In addition, you can also see some Koran decorations in the temple, and there is a yellow explanatory diagram on the wall, telling people the correct mode of worship. In addition, the mosque has an auditorium with a capacity of 380 people and two classrooms, where lectures and lectures can be held. If you are hungry, there is also a mosque restaurant here, which can be used for tourists to eat and also to hold some religious events."
