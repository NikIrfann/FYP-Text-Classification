The three-headed elephant is the Erawan Elephant god in Thai folk tales. It is the mount of Indra, a god in Brahmanism. Indra is known to be the guardian of the heaven, Indra's name has the meaning of 'leader of the gods', while Erawan's name means rain, raincloud, rainbow. This is reflected in the myth that Indra would ride the Erawan Elephant and bestow rain upon the earth. The construction of this three-headed elephant god began in 1994 and was slowly restored by hiring local handicraft artists. During the construction period, many miracles happened, so even now, countless people still go to worship it every day. It can be regarded as the elephant god who responds to all requests."
