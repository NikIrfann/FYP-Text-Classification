However, if the speed is maintained, it only lasts for a short time.

The old city is very large and is the largest Medina in Morocco. There are nearly 10,000 alleys in the old city, which are narrow and winding like a labyrinth, so it is known as a city without cars in the world, and donkeys are a very important means of transportation. The old city is a very important tourist destination in Fes. The leather dyeing workshop, the Blue Gate of Boujlou, and the University of Carouin are all distributed in the alleys here."

The second is the museum, which is divided into two exhibition rooms. One is the exhibition of jewelry and musical instruments of the past dynasties, and the other is the national costumes of the past dynasties, including Berber, Saharan, Moroccan Jewish costumes, and ancient copper and earthenware utensils; the third is a high-altitude platform , which is the relic of the ancient air market.

It is a large-scale temple complex in ancient Egypt and an ancient temple in Thebes. Founded in 2000 BC, more than 50 pharaohs participated in the construction. It was not until the 3rd century BC that the temple, which had been built for a long time in the history of civilization, was finally completed. The temple is divided into three parts by brick walls, the middle part is better preserved and the larger part, it is dedicated to the sun god Amon (Amon). The one on the left is dedicated to the god Montu, while the other is dedicated to the wife of the god Amun, the goddess Mut in the form of a vulture, but has not yet been excavated. In addition, there are dozens of temples of various sizes in the complex. There are two rows of statues with heads of sphinxes and rams on both sides of the Shinto that leads to the pylon of Karnak Temple. It is said that in history, this Shinto, guarded by a sheep-headed sphinx, leads to the Luxor Temple, which is 3 kilometers away. Throughout the temple, you can see many frescoes, statues, and pillars that use mud and stones to restore and glue the fragmented monuments together. This is because the Karnak Temple has been built more than 4,000 years ago, and it has been more than 2,000 years since its completion. Due to man-made and natural destruction, the temple was once beyond recognition.

When the cable car slowly travels to the top of the mountain, through the glass windows around the cable car, you can clearly see everything under your feet. When the cable car travels halfway, you can see the wall of Table Mountain, which is as steep as a knife and an axe. You can also see rock climbers climbing the cliffs of Table Mountain. The whole process takes about 10 minutes, reaching the top of the mountain, out of the cable car building, you can see the land and rocks under your feet, from a distance, the road to the top of the mountain is so flat. When the weather is clear, you can see a blue sky in the sky. There are trails and signs on the top of the mountain, as well as signs to protect animals. Walk slowly along the rocky road to the edge of the cliff, where thick railings and handrails are built to prevent tourists from accidentally slipping. At the foot of the valley, all kinds of trees form undulating waves, and the eyes are green. In addition, the rock wall of the mountain peak is also like a knife and axe, covered with black-brown basalt rock, everywhere. Looking into the distance, the sea is thousands of waves, and the silver-white edge flashes a certain light in the slightly dimmed sunlight. Thin clouds and light smoke floated on the sea, and the sun softened a lot. The sea and the innocence are truly connected in a line, and in the misty smoke, the sea and the sky cannot be distinguished. There is a topographic map of Table Mountain on the top of the mountain, and you can take pictures with it. Standing on the east side of Table Mountain, the scenery you see is part of the Atlantic Ocean, Lion Rock and Signal Mountain. To the north of Table Mountain, you can see the endless mountains against the blue sky. To the west of Table Mountain, you can also see part of the Atlantic Ocean, as well as Table Bay, as well as the mountains connecting Table Mountain and the winding mountain road. It can be said that no matter which side of Table Mountain you see, there are beautiful scenery. Detouring to the other side of Table Mountain, a viewing platform surrounded by the same stone guardrail was built on the protruding rock. Looking far from the observation deck, you can also see the bustling city of Cape Town, the blue swimming pool that almost every household has, and the beautiful Robin Island. In addition to the beautiful scenery on the top of the mountain, there are many small animals, such as small lizards, rock rabbits, squirrels, etc., they are not afraid of people, and sometimes they are allowed to take pictures in front of your camera. In the evening, when the weather is relatively clear, the sunset is sometimes dyed and hidden in the clouds, with a thin layer of crimson, which is very beautiful."

Built around 2580 BC, this pyramid is not only a symbol of Egypt, it is also the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The appearance of the pyramids To visit the Pyramid of Khufu, you must first enter the Giza Pyramid Scenic Spot. After entering, the first thing you see is the Pyramid of Khufu. It is a relatively well-preserved pyramid so far. Although the top has been weathered for a long time, it is still a A huge building with a height of 40 stories. From a distance, the pyramid is an isosceles triangle on all sides, and the entire tower is made of 2.3 million boulders. At the foot of the pyramid, you can climb a few levels symbolically. Inside the Pyramid Of course, in addition to seeing the huge appearance of the pyramid from the outside, you can also visit the inside. Although ventilation equipment is installed inside the pyramid, it will still be stuffy due to the narrow tomb passage inside the pyramid, so it is recommended that tourists with poor health do what they can. The entrance to the tomb of the pyramid is at a height of 18 meters above the ground, and the entrance faces the Big Dipper. Photography is not allowed inside the interior, and the interior corridors are illuminated. Stepping on the steep wooden stairs after entering, you can imagine the ancient Egyptians carrying the pharaoh's sarcophagus, going up the corridor, and placing the sarcophagus in the secret chamber of the pyramid. Walking up the corridor step by step in the pyramid, the footsteps will become heavier, and people will feel more and more stuffy, and then come to the Pharaoh's secret room. The secret room is a small room made of granite, 42.28 meters above the ground. For many years, people thought the pyramids contained the treasures and mummies of the pharaohs. But when archaeologists entered the pyramid in 1881, they found that there was only an empty coffin in the middle tomb. In the pharaoh's secret room, you can see an open dark red granite empty sarcophagus placed in the middle of the secret room. Back then, the pharaoh's treasure had been looted, and only this empty coffin could not be moved. You can walk in and touch the empty coffin and see the ancient Egyptian writings and patterns on the empty coffin. In the secret room, some tourists may be seen lying directly on the ground, and some tourists are sitting cross-legged and closed their eyes. They seem to want to absorb the aura of the pyramid. To this day, many people still believe that the pyramids have a special power. From the secret room, walk slowly back along the corridor. As your eyes brighten, you return to the exit. In a moment, you may have a wonderful feeling of returning to the world."

It is a building that combines a palace and a military fortress, standing on the heights of the ancient city. The Pope's Palace is divided into two parts: the old hall and the new hall. The old hall is unpretentious and belongs to the Roman architectural style; the new hall is magnificent and is a typical Gothic building. The outer side of the building is defended by a magnificent city tower and guarded by heavy troops. 10 towers dominate the surrounding of the palace. The icons and furnishings inside the palace were almost completely destroyed and looted, but now from the spacious and high conference hall and the elaborately carved ceilings above the Pope's bedroom, one can vaguely imagine what the glory days looked like.

Fort Saint-Michel and its bay were declared a World Heritage Site in 1979. The mystical and isolated island of Fort Saint-Michel is located in a conical arrangement of small islands made of towering granite. The bay of Saint-Malo where it is located is a tidal flat, and the tides continuously wash the sediment ashore, making the Fort Saint-Michel an isolated island, which only rises to the sea when the tide is high, which is quite mysterious. Tour Overview It is also a good place to stay if you want to catch a breathtaking view of the sunrise and dusk. To get to Fort St. Michel, you can take a car through the embankment road, or you can choose a walking plank road to enjoy the beautiful view of Fort St. Michel surrounded by the sea. Tide Watching Guide To watch the tide at Fort Saint-Michel is one of the main purposes of most tourists. The tide season is generally in spring every year, and the tidal drop can be as high as 15 meters. The parking lot at the foot of the mountain will also be submerged when the tide is high. Since the bay has little deep water and a flat bottom, the sea is 15 to 20 kilometers away from the shore at low tide. Usually the speed of high tide is equivalent to a person's walking speed - 4 kilometers per hour, and the speed increases to 30 kilometers per hour when the wind is down. Every evening, the tide of the Atlantic Ocean rushed over like a galloping horse, submerging the quicksand on the side of the mountain, and the holy mountain suddenly turned into an ocean. 6 hours after the high tide, the tide is low, and the low tide of the bay often starts very suddenly. Maybe a few minutes ago, the sea was endless and unfathomable, and suddenly the sea receded into the distance, and the beach was bare and the color on the beach was everywhere. Very special quicksand. Visiting the Saint-Michel Abbey Fort Saint-Michel is a wonder of the natural world, and the Saint-Michel Abbey on the mountain has a supreme position in the minds of Christians, its name comes from the Archangel Saint-Michel , The cardinal at that time dreamed of a sandbar in the sea for three consecutive days while practicing nearby, indicating that a church should be built here. The Saint-Michel Abbey was built in the 11th century, after which it has integrated a variety of architectural styles and is the main building of the Fort Saint-Michel. The reddish-brown stone ancient city wall is full of a strong medieval atmosphere, and the golden archangel statue on the top shines in the sun. The parquet marble floor in the main hall is very gorgeous, and the towering vault is simple and elegant. The cloisters and gardens next to the main hall are very quiet, ideal for taking a break or contemplating for a while. From the viewing platform of the cloister, you can also overlook the beautiful view of the church, the street and the beach. Visit the Saint-Michel Museum For an in-depth look at the history of Fort Saint-Michel, visit the nearby Saint-Michel Museum. There are various historical materials and exhibits related to Saint Michel Fort, Saint Michel Abbey, tides, navigation, etc., which are very interesting. In addition, the foothills of the mountain are also full of various shops and restaurants. The medieval-style storefront decoration and carved copper signboards are very distinctive. If you have enough time, you may wish to take a stroll here."

It was originally a royal hunting palace and was expanded into an important palace in the French Renaissance. Later, many architects and artists participated in the reconstruction, so it left the imprint of the styles of various periods. Location Fontainebleau is a small town located about 55 kilometers southeast of Paris. It is one of the favorite weekend excursions of Parisians. The Palace of Fontainebleau is located here, surrounded by forests. The Fontainebleau Forest surrounding the palace was originally a royal hunting ground, and now it has become an outdoor sports base for bouldering enthusiasts. The bouldering season in October attracts many rock climbers from all over the world. The main building of the Palace of Fontainebleau includes a main tower, six palaces, five courtyards and four gardens. The main attractions in the palace are the ballroom, the conference hall, the chapel, the throne hall, the Diana fresco promenade, the François I promenade, the queen's bedroom, the Napoleon's living room, and the Pope's apartment. Napoleon loves yellow, and his wife Josephine prefers roses, so the overall colors of the interior decoration are mainly yellow and rose red. There are also four museums in the palace, namely the China Pavilion, the Napoleon I Pavilion, the Gallery, and the Home Pavilion. Among them, the Chinese Pavilion has a large collection of precious cultural relics from Yuanmingyuan, and displays thousands of art treasures such as ancient paintings, gold and jade jewelry, and sculptures of China's Ming and Qing Dynasties, but sometimes it is not open to visit. Among Western museums, the Palace of Fontainebleau is the collection and exhibition of Yuanmingyuan treasures. #White Horse Court# The White Horse Court is the main entrance to Fontainebleau. The horseshoe-shaped steps here are a scene of the Palace of Fontainebleau, where Napoleon gave his speech when he abdicated. #China Pavilion# Entering the building from the right side of the courtyard is the ticket office. Don't forget to lead the audio guide after purchasing the ticket. Then walk along this promenade and start to visit the Palace of Fontainebleau. There are stairs near the end, so don't rush upstairs, just keep going to the China Pavilion. If you can't find the location of the China Pavilion, you can ask the staff. The door of the China Pavilion is generally closed, and it needs to be closed after entering. There is a golden pagoda about 2 meters high in a prominent position in the museum. The whole body is inlaid with emeralds on every floor, which is basically similar to the existing golden pagoda in the Forbidden City in Beijing. There are also two precious gilt bells and other various Yuanmingyuan treasures. Except for weekends and holidays, the China Pavilion is closed earlier, so you can visit it in the morning. On March 1, 2015, 15 exhibits were stolen from the Palace of Fontainebleau, including the cloisonné unicorn and the golden manza in the old collection of Yuanmingyuan. #other treasures# Go upstairs from the China Pavilion, and you can continue to enjoy the Napoleon I Pavilion, the Throne Hall (Napoleon's throne is very small) and many other rooms. You can also see the François I promenade. The lower half is made of golden yellow fine wood carvings about 2 meters high as a retaining wall. Exquisite murals, the entire promenade is both brilliant and elegant. After visiting the main exhibition halls, go down to the first floor to the exit, where there is a souvenir shop, and you can go out to browse the courtyard and garden. In fact, you can also go back to the China Pavilion after a short walk from the exit, but there is only a hint to enter the courtyard. In addition to the indoor landscape, the courtyard of the Palace of Fontainebleau is also very characteristic. The decorative style of the combination of thin wood retaining walls, plaster reliefs and murals is very unique. In Diana's garden, there are flower beds and sculptures, as well as small and exquisite fountains. You can also roam freely in the large park green forest. There is a tea room in the scenic area of Fontainebleau Palace, and there are many restaurants in the town with moderate prices."

The Louvre Museum usually displays 10% of its total collection which will feast your eyes.""Three Treasures of the Louvre"": ""Venus de Milo"", ""Mona Lisa"" and "" The Winged Victory of Samothrace"".
△ The Louvre’s gallery of antiquities, which replaced the royal apartments, displays masterpieces of Greek sculpture – including the famous Venus de Milo. You would need a heart of stone not to be moved by her grace!Aphrodite or Amphitrite?When she first arrived at the Louvre, it was suggested that her missing arms should be restored, but the idea was eventually abandoned for fear of changing the nature of the work.The lack of arms made it hard to identify the statue. Many depictions of Greek gods and goddesses contain clues to their identity in the form of ‘attributes’ (objects or natural elements) held in their hands, so this sculpture poses a problem: is she the sea goddess Amphitrite, particularly worshipped on the island of Melos? Or is she Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty, as might be suggested by her sensual, half-naked body? This second argument, and the jewellery she once wore, tipped the scales in favour of Aphrodite (‘Venus’ for the Romans). Another possible clue was found near the statue: a hand holding an apple – an attribute of Aphrodite – carved from the same Parian marble.
△ This is the most famous portrait in the world. It shows Lisa Gherardini, wife of the Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo – hence her Italian name La Gioconda and her French name La Joconde. Painted against a distant landscape, she stares out at us with her famously enigmatic smile...The theft of the centuryOn 21 August 1911, panic broke out at the Louvre…the Mona Lisa had disappeared! The news spread like wildfire and generous rewards were promised for her return – but all in vain. Nothing was heard of the painting for over two years. Then one day, Vincenzo Peruggia, a glazier who had worked at the Louvre, tried to sell the world’s most famous painting to an Italian art dealer...who alerted the authorities. So the Mona Lisa was recovered – and her fame was all the greater.
△ She seems to float through the air! Placed at a height, people could see her from afar. It was made as an offering to the gods for a sanctuary on the Greek island of Samothrace. Placed at a height, people could see her from afar. That is why, in a nod to her original lofty home, she now adorns the top of the Daru staircase. Nike, the winged goddess who heralds victory, is seen just as she is about to alight on a ship.A monumental staircaseThe Daru staircase is the perfect setting for this extraordinary display. It is one of six grand staircases built during the Second Empire in the 19th century by the architect Hector Lefuel.During the 1850s and 1860s, major works were underway to expand the Louvre and make it more modern. The former palace had already been partially transformed into a museum. The emperor Napoleon III had a new wing built to make more room to showcase more art. The old staircase built by his uncle Napoleon I was no longer adequate to access all the galleries. The only things left from that time are the ceilings leading to the Italian painting collections and the name Daru, a minister under Napoleon I.Hector Lefuel took up the challenge to design a new monumental space on three levels leading in four different directions. Visitors could choose themselves which way to go!The Winged Victory of Samothrace was placed in her new home on the upper landing in 1883, some 20 years after the statue was discovered."

The reason why it is called Condor Plaza is that a bronze statue of the tallest condor in the world was originally erected here. Here you can also overlook the beautiful scenery of southern Bali. Origin of Condor Plaza In 2003, the Indonesian government started construction of Condor Plaza. It plans to build a statue of the Hindu God of Destruction and its mount condor on the mountain. The overall height will reach more than 100 meters. It is said that an eminent monk once instructed Suharto that after the bronze statue is cast, it will bless the prosperity of the Indonesian nation and the happiness and safety of the people, but Suharto stepped down before the square was completed, so this hugely expensive project was put on hold.” The upper body, hands, and the head of the condor were scattered in different parts of the square. Despite the statue of Condor Plaza, the ""unfinished project"" of Condor Plaza is still worth seeing. From Jimbaran to the south, along JlUluwatu Street, you can come to the hill where Condor Plaza is located. After entering the door and walking up the stairs, you will see a snake wearing a laurel crown and a slender body coiled on one side. This hill is about 200 meters high. When you come to the top of the mountain, you can see the huge bronze statue of ""Destruction God"" Vishnu. Although only the head and chest are completed, the lifelike facial expressions are still very vivid. Deterrent. The arm of the ""God of Destruction"" was placed beside a small road in the middle of the mountain, so you can look for it. Going further inside, you will see the head statue of a giant condor overlooking the flat square in front of you. This square was dug down from the mountain with a large excavator. The tall and neat stone walls around the square were originally intended to be carved with Hindu inscriptions and stories of mythical figures."

It is the largest Buddhist architectural complex in the world and is listed as a world cultural heritage. Borobudur means ""a pagoda on a hill"", but there is no written record of who built it and it is very mysterious. When you come to the Borobudur Stupa, you will definitely be shocked by it. This big Buddhist pagoda is built with local volcanic rock. The tower is 10 layers and consists of 6 huge square platforms, 3 circular platforms and the middle dome. The base is more than 100 meters long and the total height is more than 40 meters. It is quite majestic . There are more than 2,600 reliefs and more than 500 Buddha statues on the pagoda. Climbing up the steps can take a closer look. The stone walls of the corridors on each floor are full of lifelike reliefs, with delicate and exquisite carvings and various patterns. Some depict Buddhist stories, and some vividly reflect the daily life of the people and various livestock, flowers, birds, fish and insects. The Buddha statues, large and small, have different expressions and postures, which are enough to look at for a long time. Climbing to the top, you can see the pointed dome in the middle, which is surrounded by more than 70 Buddha statues sitting in the hollowed-out stupa. The scene is very awe-inspiring. You can see the Buddha statues inside through the hollowed out stupa, and there are also a few Buddha statues that are half exposed, taller than people, and particularly eye-catching. When the weather is fine, standing at the top of the pagoda can overlook Mount Merapi, and these sitting Buddha statues seem to be staring into the distance just like you, which is very artistic. Borobudur is also a good place to watch the sunrise. Many people make a special trip in the early morning when it is quiet, waiting for the sun to rise and the sun to shine on the pagodas and Buddha statues."

It is a grass park in the second construction site of Lanzhi Island. It used to be an area with poor soil on Lanzhi Island. Sky Park is famous for its 291 steps, from which you can overlook the panoramic view of Seoul. Boundless Grass Sky Park is characterized by a vast expanse of grass. The ridge line made for the convenience of drainage is the boundary line, and it is divided into 4 areas according to the X-shape. The taller grass is planted on the north and south sides, and the short grass is planted on the east and west sides. In the north of the tall grasslands, there are purple awns. In the rippling purple awn group, citizens can feel the nature. In the low grasslands, there are native varieties such as large thistle, violet and bitterweed, and naturalized varieties such as white alfalfa. Among them, white alfalfa can help other plants grow and promote soil decomposition, which is a very suitable plant for places like Laneige Island. Since 2,000 years ago, more than 30,000 butterflies, including yellow butterflies, blue swallowtail butterflies, nymph butterflies, and golden swallowtail butterflies, have been released on Lanzhi Island with Sky Park as the center. In spring and early summer, butterflies flying in the sky help pollinate plants, which has greatly contributed to the stability of the plant ecosystem in Laneige Island. Another feature of walking up the stairs and looking at Yuanjing Sky Park is that there will be 219 steps along the road, and each step is marked with numbers. Walking up the steps is like walking towards the sky step by step, standing in the Sky Park on Lanzhi Island. From here, the scenery of Seoul catches your eye at a glance, with Bukhan Mountain in the north, Namsan Mountain and 63 Building in the east gate, Han River in the south, and Lucky State Mountain Fortress in the west. In order to take full advantage of such excellent viewing conditions, there is an observation deck on the inclined surface, so that visitors can rest at any time. The bushes outside the park are 1~1.5m higher than the grass, and many large trees like oaks are planted to allow visitors to rest in the shade."

At present, there are more than 20 murals and 52 iron sculpture cartoons in George Town, which are distributed on the streets of LebuhChulia, LebuhAhQuee, LebuhVictoria and LebuhArmenian. Ernest Zacharevic has 8 murals here. ""Photo with the Old Man"" on LebuhArmenian Street, this is his first work, the fresco has begun to fade due to the age. There is also a well-known copy of ""Sister and Brother Riding Together"" on this street. In the picture, an older sister who is not very skilled in driving takes her excited and nervous younger brother on a bicycle and does not know where to go. Many tourists will put out the action of pushing the back seat of the bicycle, or the action of actually riding the bicycle behind them, which is very interesting. In addition, several well-known works are ""Broken Heart"" by Love Lane, ""Kung Fu Girl"" by LebuhMuntri, ""The Boy Who Chased the Wind"" by LebuhAhQuee Street, and ""The Resting Tricycle Driver"" by PenangRoad Wait. Today, in addition to the original murals, Chinese painter Chen Yukang has created many art works about cats together with the ""101 Lost Cats"" organization. In addition, Penang also has a ""Sign George Town Project"", which uses comic-style iron sculpture murals to tell the legends of the old street or the life of the citizens. A total of 52 iron plastic cartoons for the ""Sign George Town Project"" are the works of SculptureAtWork, a local art group that won the ""Sign George Town Project"" competition. As long as you walk on the streets of Penang, you will always find many vivid and interesting cartoons, which will add some childishness to the nostalgic Penang."

Three-quarters of the entire mosque is built on Lake Brat, also known as the Water Mosque. It's visually stunning thanks to its pink dome topped with granite. The construction of the mosque started in 1997 at a huge cost and can accommodate 15,000 people. The exterior is all pink, quite soft in color, and built with a lot of rose marble. The mosque has nine domes and can reach a height of 50 meters. Standing on Prince Edward Square is a good spot to photograph the exterior of the mosque. Between the blue sky, white clouds and clear water, the pink sanctuary is so beautiful that you can't take your eyes off it. It is not like the Forbidden City in Beijing, as red as a red flame rose. This mosque is more like a pink holy lotus blooming on the water, with a clear rhythm and a pure dream. The mosque is mainly composed of three parts: the prayer hall, the big minaret and the mausoleum. The roof of the hall looks like an open umbrella. It consists of 49 large and small round arches with 18 radiating stars, representing the 13 states of the country and the five commandments of Islam. The shape of the spire of the big minaret is like a rocket, the whole tower is 73 meters high, and there are elevators and stairs leading to the upper end. The mausoleum is built behind the mosque, where only the national heroes of Islam are buried. Most of the people who came to the mosque were tour groups from China and India. Because of time constraints, most of these tour groups just took pictures on the outside. If you are an independent tourist, you can visit it if you have enough time, because the interior of the mosque is actually more magnificent than the dreamy appearance. There is a red sign at the entrance of the mosque that says that non-Muslims, women who are menstruating and children under the age of five are not allowed to enter the prayer hall. All visitors must be properly dressed and not revealing when entering. Quiet loud noises in the temple, no smoking. Therefore, whether it is a boy or a girl, you can get a red or blue robe for free at the entrance, wear it on your body, and wear a hat at the same time.

In addition, the shoes must also be taken off, you can put them on the rack specially for shoes, just remember where you put them. After entering, there will be a staff member who will explain it for free. Photography is prohibited in the prayer hall, please strictly abide by it. There are no idols in the temple, because Muslims do their prayers in the direction of Mecca. The mosque is divided into two floors, the second floor can be used exclusively by 4,000 women, and the downstairs can be used by 8,000 men. Muslims will worship at a certain time every day. At this time, the sound of the Koran played in the high minaret of the mosque lingers melodiously in the sky above the mosque, which is very pleasant. The design of the mosque is quite environmentally friendly. The prayer hall is very spacious. There are 12 pillars in it. The center of the pillars is a vacuum design. When the weather is hot, the motor at the bottom of the lake can be pumped into the interior, so it will feel slightly cool when entering the mosque. In addition, you can also see some Koran decorations in the temple, and there is a yellow explanatory diagram on the wall, telling people the correct mode of worship. In addition, the mosque has an auditorium with a capacity of 380 people and two classrooms, where lectures and lectures can be held.

The Maori Cultural Village is a collection of ancient Maori houses after renovation, with early buildings such as conference halls, housing and storage rooms. The houses of the early Maori were made of rushes and palm branches, which were simple and low, and could not straighten their waists. All kinds of storage rooms are supported by high feet. The tool room is similar to the bamboo building of the Dai people in Yunnan, my country, but it is shorter. There is an exhibition hall in the center of the village, which displays unique Maori carvings, which is a good place for tourists to learn about Maori culture.

Made entirely of rock blocks, this church is a classic postcard view of Lake Tekapo. At night, the church under the stars is even more beautiful, and it is also an excellent location for shooting star trails. 1. The appearance of the church is primitive and simple. Although it is not big, it has a unique flavor. The area of the church is only 20 to 30 square meters, which is very small. There is a small stone cross on the north roof, a small bell tower on the west side of the south roof, and a small bronze bell hangs in the arched wall hole. The outer wall of the entire church is a random combination of the original dark gray, light gray, cyan and brown of the rock, while the roof is a black stone piece. Such a primitive and rustic appearance makes it special in this open lakeside wilderness. Harmony and harmony. Although the church is small, it is very famous. During the day, there will be buses with tour groups arriving one after another. At night, you often encounter people who bring professional photography equipment to take pictures of the stars. Walking into the church, there are five or six rows of benches on the left and right sides. From the middle aisle to the pulpit by the window, a cross ten centimeters high stands in front of the glass window, against the light, outside the window is the blue sky and white clouds and the lake water. Great view, with views of Mount Cook in the distance. 2. Bronze statue of a shepherd dog next to the church A towering bronze statue of a shepherd dog can be seen not far from the church. It is used to commemorate the contribution made by the shepherd dog to protecting the flock. The statue is also engraved with ""No Shepherd"". Dogs, there would be no small town today"" and other words. 3. Look up at the starry sky and watch the unique astronomical scene. If you plan to go here in the middle of the night, you need to check whether the weather is fine in advance. When you lie on a bench by the lake and look up at the stars, you can see unique astronomical sights that can only be seen in the southern hemisphere, such as the Southern Cross constellation, the Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way satellite galaxies, etc. If you are lucky, you can even see meteors passing by night sky. With the exception of the Church of the Good Shepherd, the entire Lake Tekapo area is a good spot for stargazing as long as you stay away from street lights. Of course, if the budget is sufficient, you can also sign up for the stargazing cluster on Mount John."

One of the famous sea temples is located in Cape Sounion, southeast of Athens, at the southern tip of the Attica peninsula, about 70 kilometers away from Athens. The temple stands on a cliff about 65 meters high, which is the best place to enjoy the view of the Aegean Sea and sunset. Cape Sunu is surrounded by the sea on three sides, with the Aegean Sea on the left, the Mediterranean Sea on the front, and the Ionian Sea on the right. In the past, Athenians believed that places with better views were suitable for building temples for the gods of worship. The Temple of Poseidon was built in 444-440 BC to protect sailors going out to sea and pray for good weather, before it was destroyed by the Byzantine Emperor Arcadios in 399 BC. Climbing up the hillside on the west side of the parking lot at Cape Sounion, you can see the charming style of this temple: Like other temples in Greece, the Temple of Poseidon is rectangular, about 80 meters long and 60 meters wide. There are 34 marble columns in total, but only 13 of them have been preserved. The stone columns are about 6 meters high and adopt the Doric style. The Temple of Agriculture is similar. The relief decorations on the stone pillars depict scenes of the battle of the gods, and some of the original reliefs are currently in the collection of the Acropolis Museum. When the poet Byron visited Greece in the 19th century, he carved his name on a column of the temple of Tanah Lot. The location, construction and design of the Temple of Poseidon make it conspicuous from the sea and visible to the naked eye from a distance. This gave great help to ancient ships. Returning sailors can also rely on it to identify their direction. The same not to be missed as the Poseidon Sea Temple is the beautiful sunset landscape here, the blue Aegean Sea is looking down, the gorgeous sunset is looking up, and the ships are dotted in the distance, which is very beautiful."

This is the one occasion where I would say that paying extra to skip the queue is really worth it!!! The Sugar Loaf cable car ride is actually divided into two separate segments. This means that you queue to get tickets, queue to board the first cable car, queue to board the second cable car, and then queue twice more to go back down - and each time you’re queuing for about 30 minutes! And this was on a Tuesday in July; I can’t imagine what it’s like on the weekend. Anyway, the pictures show that it was definitely worth the effort:)Available TomorrowBrazil · Rio de JaneiroFrom RM 188.20",https://my.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/rio-de-janeiro/sugarloaf-mountain-10559686/?locale=en-MY&curr=MYR,,,South America,Sugarloaf Mountain,"Sugarloaf Mountain is located at the mouth of Guanabara Bay. It consists of two hills. Because its shape resembles a mold for making bread, it has the reputation of ""Sugarloaf Mountain"". It occupies an important military location. The Portuguese A fortress was built under the mountain to defend the territory. 1. Watching guide After taking the cable car to the peak, look north, you will have a panoramic view of the Flamenco Riviera Park; look south, Copacabana Beach is close at hand; look east, the statue of Jesus Christ is awe-inspiring Respect; looking west, the sea level of the Atlantic Ocean is vast. Try to avoid the tourist peaks of 10:00-11:00 and 14:00-15:00. It is a good time to climb Bread Mountain around 4:00 in the afternoon. At this time, you can enjoy the sunset in the direction of Jesus Mountain. The scene of burning clouds is very Majestic. 2. The place where the success rate of marriage proposals is high It is said that Sugarloaf Mountain is still the place where the success rate of marriage proposals is relatively high. Take her beloved to the top of Sugarloaf Mountain, and promise her a lifetime on the picturesque peak, which is very romantic. In addition, a restaurant, Cota200Restauran, was built on the mountain, where you can enjoy delicious food and enjoy the beautiful scenery again and again."
