Not choosing the same address shows that the citizens at that time sought independence as their economic strength grew, and were no longer subject to the bishop. The craftsmen formed 15 guilds, which in 1501 carried out the decision of the municipal council to join the Swiss Confederation. To commemorate this event, at the beginning of the 16th century, the first half of the then town hall was replaced by a very famous new building. The battlements have also been renovated, surrounded by very rich colors, with 12 badges hanging, representing the 12 cantons, including Basel, which joined the Swiss Confederation at the time. At the beginning of the 17th century, the town hall was enlarged, and HansBock painted the wider and longer walls, with imitation architecture. In 1900, the town hall was further expanded, adding a annex on the left and a tower on the right. At the same time, the original rear building built in the 14th century was demolished and a new building was built. This was a period of historicism, as the architects used elements from the traditional style, some old parts and their architectural forms were incorporated into the new building, but the whole decoration was of a very new style at the time, known as Art Nouveau."

The wine cellar, the choir, the tomb of Erasmus in Rotterdam, the Galluspforte and the two cloisters bear witness to the vicissitudes of the cathedral over the centuries. Basel's history as an urban settlement begins in Chapel Hill. In the first century BC, Celts from the Rauricii tribe lived in the fortified ""oppidum"". Today, the remains of the ""Celtic Wall"" can still be seen in the semi-underground windows of the Rittergasse. In 15 BC, the Roman army established a military base on Chapel Hill on the border between the Roman Empire and the Germanic tribes. In the center of the Münsterplatz square, you can see a hidden Roman well leading to the groundwater of the Rhine. In the late Roman Empire, Christianity was established in the Basel area. Existing documents record bishops who came to Basel from the Roman republic of Augusta Raurica, located about 10 kilometers upstream of the Rhine. But in fact, the names of all the bishops who have lived in Basel since the 8th century are now known. The cathedral dates back to the reign of Charlemagne, and the building was destroyed in 917 when the Hungarians attacked the entire city. At the beginning of the 11th century, Henry II built a magnificent new church for Basel. During the 25 years at the end of the 12th century, the church of Henry's period was replaced by Romanesque buildings, and after the earthquake in 1356, it was renovated into a Gothic church. Around the Münsterplatz square, the priests of the church built their own post-Gothic residences, and the open space was used for commemorative processions, festivals, competitions and grand military parades for visiting people. In 1529, Basel became fully Protestant. Bishops and clergy left the city, and the clergy's empty homes were sold to wealthy merchants. In the 18th century, the church became post-Baroque and Neoclassical, while Münsterplatz became a quiet and prosperous residential area, and later the administrative center of Basel. Today, this magnificent square is used as a venue for various events and an open space for people to meet."

The British garden covering an area of 2.5 10,000 square meters, the largest of the series of city parks on the shore of Lake Geneva in downtown Geneva. In 1854, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Geneva's accession to the Swiss Confederation, the English garden was built on the shore of Lake Geneva on the north side of the old town. Another hundred years - 1955, the world's first flower clock was built on the southwest edge of the garden.

Castle History The historical records of Chillon Castle can be traced back to the 11th century. Since ancient Roman times, it has been the main traffic road between Italy and France. In the 12th century, it became the residence of the Italian Savoy family, in 1536. After being administered by the Swiss in Bern, it was used as an official residence and armory.

Prison The prison is located on the east side of the entrance to the first floor of the castle, where the curved vault of the 13th-century Gothic church is preserved, all around it is built of rock. More than 200 prisoners were imprisoned that year. In 1532, the abbot of St. Victor Abbey in Geneva, Boniwain, advocated the independence of Geneva, and was chained to the stone pillar for four years until March 29, 1536 in Switzerland. After the people captured the castle, they released him. In 1816, when the British poet Byron visited Chillon Castle, he heard about this tragic history, so he left his signature on the stone pillar and wrote ""The Prisoner of Chillon"". There are many magnificent halls in the castle. They were once the place where the Safoy family feasted, and now they are also used to undertake various banquets, dances and birthday parties. The windows of all the halls face Lake Geneva, and the windows open to the charming scenery composed of Lake Geneva and the surrounding mountains.

Bourne's bedroom, with its large comfortable four-poster bed with heating, private bathroom and modern plumbing, is well worth a look.
