It is very wide. ""Iguazu"" means ""huge water"" in the language of the Guarani people, the indigenous people of South America. The waterfall is located on the border between Argentina and Brazil. In 1984, Iguazu Falls was listed as a World Natural Heritage by UNESCO. The difference between Iguazu Falls is that there are many viewing points. From different locations, different directions, and different heights, you can see different scenes. The entire waterfall group is numerous, majestic and powerful, which is unforgettable for a lifetime. 1. The history of the waterfall In 1542, a Spanish missionary accidentally discovered the Iguazu Falls in the tropical rain forest of the Parana River Basin in South America. The rumbling sound of the waterfall spread dozens of kilometers away. The fact that Iguazu can form such a spectacular waterfall here is inseparable from its geological and geographical conditions. Magma erupted 1.2 billion years ago to form the current terrain. The Paraná River Valley in Brazil is a north-south basalt. The Iguazu River and its riverbed rock formations are just perpendicular to the Paraná River, and the scouring and erosion of the river water is far weaker than that of the Paraná River. Day after day, the level difference of the riverbed is formed at the confluence of the Iguazu River and the Paraná River. After countless days and nights, the majestic Iguazu Falls have formed such a majestic appearance . Until now, the Great Falls are still changing, and will continue to do so. The formation of a basalt highland at the beginning can not help but make people feel full of emotion. 2. A detailed introduction to the waterfall The Iguazu River originates from the Mar Mountains near Curitiba, and flows westward through the Brazilian plateau for 1,320 kilometers before joining the Paraná River. There are as many as 30 large and small rivers along the way. Flowing to the Iguazu Falls, the river widened to 4 kilometers. The Iguazu River runs thousands of miles to the border between the two countries. When it falls steeply from the basalt cliff to the Paraná River Gorge, the river is divided into 275 large and small waterfalls by the rocks and dense trees at the fault, falling into an average The semi-circular waterfall group with a drop of 72 meters. Due to the large amount of water in the river, it converges into a majestic waterfall here, and its water flow reaches 1,700 cubic meters per second. The power, shape and loud noise of Iguazu Falls will only be believed if you experience it for yourself, and the countless bizarre rainbows formed under the reflection of the sun are spectacular. Iguazu Falls far exceeds Niagara Falls in North America in terms of height and width, and the scenery is more majestic. The sound of its waterfalls can be heard 30 kilometers away, which is a wonder on earth. Iguazu Falls is located in the subtropical zone, and the water volume does not change much throughout the year. From January to March, it is the local rainy season, and the flow of the waterfall is large, which is a good viewing season. From August to October, it is the dry season, and the flow of the waterfall is small. 3. The water flow is large and violent. The main part of the river falls from a narrow semi-circular fissure. The scene is described as ""the sea pouring into the abyss"". This section can be seen on both sides of Brazil and Argentina. During the flood season, the width is 3.5 to 4 kilometers, and the drop is 60 to 82 meters. The thunder-like falling sound is 25 kilometers away from the surrounding area, and the splashing fog is like a bead curtain. There is a feeling. 4. Excursion project in the park A few years ago, the Iguazu Falls tourist area was operated by a private company. This company built a tourist plank road about 20 kilometers long, laid electric railways, and the tourist facilities took a new look. In the scenic spot, you can walk along the trestle bridge, or take a tour bus to visit various scenic spots. Intimate contact with the waterfall is a more exciting activity in Foz do Iguaçu - rushing into the waterfall by speedboat, shuttle under the waterfall, very exciting and pleasant. However, this is a self-funded project, the cost is 60 US dollars once, and you need to go downstream first. First, take a sightseeing bus through the jungle (it is said that the seeds of a tree on both sides are specially used for making perfume in France, and some plants are the staple food of the Indians), and then take a jeep down a few particularly steep slopes after disembarking. To the shore speedboat departure point. Visitors need raincoats and life jackets on board the speedboat. The boat is upstream, the speed is relatively fast, and the current is also fast. This is repeated several times, which is very exciting. 5. Differences between Argentina and Brazil The waterfalls are distributed on both sides of the canyon. Argentina and Brazil are bounded by this canyon, and the waterfalls viewed in Argentina and Brazil are also very different. Brazil and Argentina have built national parks on the north and south sides of the waterfall. The Argentine National Park covers an area of 65,000 hectares. In 1975, a green railing bridge was built upstream of the waterfall. to the edge of the waterfall. The park on the Brazilian side is the largest forest reserve in Brazil, with an area of 170,000 hectares, and there are many wild animals in the park.The momentum of rolling down. On the Brazilian side there is a panoramic view of the main waterfalls on the Argentine side."

We went to the beach instead, then prebooked tickets on CTrip for the next day. The process of using the tickets was a bit confusing. When we arrived at the cable station at 15:00 we were told to go to the reception desk to have our proof of booking printed out. A kind lady at reception helped us do this luckily, but it was a bit confusing due to the language barrier. After we’d printed the proof we had to go to another window to collect our physical ticket and were then allowed to join the queue to board the cable car quite far ahead of the back of the line - so even though the process was confusing, booking online definitely helped. This is the one occasion where I would say that paying extra to skip the queue is really worth it!!! The Sugar Loaf cable car ride is actually divided into two separate segments.
