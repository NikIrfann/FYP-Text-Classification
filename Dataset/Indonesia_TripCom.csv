Hundreds of dolphins live in this area of water, and at dawn, they go out to hunt in groups, forming a spectacular ""Dolphin Legion"" on the sea. Diving resorts For more professional diving enthusiasts, there are diving resorts that are better than other shores. You can also admire tropical fish and look for small corals in this area. For those who don't know how to dive, renting a boat to see corals in the sea at a depth of 500 to 600 meters is also a unique experience. More than ten meters deep in the sea, with coral reefs, you can feel the splendor of nature without being in the water."

It is a prototype of a square left in the Suharto era and has not been completed. The reason why it is called Condor Plaza is that a bronze statue of the tallest condor in the world was originally erected here. Here you can also overlook the beautiful scenery of southern Bali. Origin of Condor Plaza In 2003, the Indonesian government started construction of Condor Plaza. It plans to build a statue of the Hindu God of Destruction and its mount condor on the mountain. The overall height will reach more than 100 meters. It is said that an eminent monk once instructed Suharto that after the bronze statue is cast, it will bless the prosperity of the Indonesian nation and the happiness and safety of the people, but Suharto stepped down before the square was completed, so this hugely expensive project was put on hold.” The upper body, hands, and the head of the condor were scattered in different parts of the square. Despite the statue of Condor Plaza, the ""unfinished project"" of Condor Plaza is still worth seeing. From Jimbaran to the south, along JlUluwatu Street, you can come to the hill where Condor Plaza is located. After entering the door and walking up the stairs, you will see a snake wearing a laurel crown and a slender body coiled on one side. This hill is about 200 meters high. When you come to the top of the mountain, you can see the huge bronze statue of ""Destruction God"" Vishnu. Although only the head and chest are completed, the lifelike facial expressions are still very vivid. Deterrent. The arm of the ""God of Destruction"" was placed beside a small road in the middle of the mountain, so you can look for it. Going further inside, you will see the head statue of a giant condor overlooking the flat square in front of you. This square was dug down from the mountain with a large excavator. The tall and neat stone walls around the square were originally intended to be carved with Hindu inscriptions and stories of mythical figures."
