Twenty kilometers from Glenorchy, as idyllic farmland is gradually replaced by beech forest, we come to the town of Paradise. The origins of the name vary, with some saying it got its name from the natural charm of the place, while others say it got its name from the ducks of paradise that inhabit it. No one can be sure of the origin of its name, but the suffocating natural beauty here has been unanimously recognized by everyone. . ""This is the Middle-earth I've always fantasized about,"" Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf) said of Paradise."

In addition to the common pebbles on the shore of Lake Wanaka, there are various minerals. 2. Life in the Lake District If you want to enjoy a leisurely lifestyle, you can go for a swim, drink coffee or just sit by the lake and enjoy the sun. Next to the lake is an endless vineyard, you can go to the garden to taste grapes, taste wine, and enjoy life.

The origin of the Twelve Apostles Rock The Twelve Apostles Rock is actually a rock standing in the sea. It was originally a part of the coastline. After the erosion of waves and strong winds, it gradually broke away. Because these twelve stone pillars are reminiscent of the twelve apostles who followed Jesus Christ in the Bible, they are named ""Twelve Apostles"". Due to the continued alluvial action of the waves, only seven remain. 2. Gibson Steps There is a well-known step on the way to the Twelve Apostles, called Gibson Steps, which is excavated from the cliff. The steps are 100 meters long, with a total of 86 steps, and it takes about 15 minutes to go back and forth. Steps lead to the beach, but the waves here are rough, not suitable for swimming, but suitable for fishing. The width of the steps is about 1 meter, which is only enough for one person to pass, so tourists with limited mobility should not try it easily. At the end, you can see the endless blue sea and two huge stone pillars. The steps are about a 2-minute drive from the rock, and there is a parking lot nearby. The parking is very convenient. After getting off the car, visitors can go from the Twelve Apostles parking lot through the gravel walking trail to the Gibson Steps. The best time to photograph the Twelve Apostles is in the early morning and at dusk. It is even more shocking to take a helicopter to overlook it. In addition, you can also participate in sea fishing, golf, water sports and other projects here. 3. Although the Twelve Apostles Rock of London Bridge and Arch is the highlight of the Great Ocean Road, there are still many places to play along the Great Ocean Road. Attractions such as London Bridge and Arch are not far away and can be visited together. The arches are suitable for viewing in the afternoon, when the view is bathed in a warm golden sun. Co-located in Port Campbell National Park are the Shipwreck Coast and La Card Canyon, only a 10-minute drive from the Twelve Apostles. Due to the rugged terrain in this area, many shipwrecks have occurred here. The sand here is soft and the views are spectacular, perfect for photography. Arch Island is also nearby, but it collapsed in 2009, which shows the fragility of the coastline."

It is the largest and longest coral group in the world. The Great Barrier Reef consists of more than 600 large and small coral reef islands, which are colorful and beautiful. The central coral reef island has become the iconic attraction of the Great Barrier Reef. 1. Attraction overview The Great Barrier Reef is home to a huge coral kingdom and thousands of marine life, as well as deep undersea cliffs, undersea tunnels and caves. Whether you are taking a helicopter to get a bird's-eye view of the corals or diving deep into the sea, you can truly appreciate it. Feel the magic of nature. When you come to the Great Barrier Reef, you can sign up for diving or semi-submersible ships to explore the underwater world. Of course, if you want to experience sailing out to sea, you can rent a variety of boats (from high-speed speedboats to catamarans) to ride the wind and waves and sail out to sea. You can also go on a cruise, depending on your time and preferences. If you want a more free sea experience, you can take a speedboat. In addition, overlooking the Great Barrier Reef by helicopter is also one of the projects not to be missed here, overlooking the world-famous Heart Reef from the air; riding a hot air balloon over the Atherton Tableland, the experience of going into the sea is not enough! 2. National Park There are many national parks near the Great Barrier Reef. In addition to the Daintree Rainforest (Daintree Rainforest), which is also a world natural heritage, there are many unmissable secret gardens waiting for you to slowly discover. Explore wildlife at Cape Tribulation and Nara Inlet on Hook Island, where rock art from the Ngaro people remains. Tourists can hire a professional guide to take you to the tropical rainforest, experience swimming, barbecue and other items in the national park. 3. Traveling methods To visit the Great Barrier Reef, you need to go to sea. Generally, you choose to start from Cairns or the Whitsundays. The Great Barrier Reef is mainly divided into the inner barrier reef and the outer barrier reef. The inner barrier reef is close to the city, and the outer barrier reef is far away from the city and has less pollution. Therefore, you must carefully choose the area you want to go according to your personal needs. 4. Daydream Island The main feature of Daydream Island is the various water sports and SPA on the island, bathed in the fragrance of nature, daydreaming here is better than sleeping."

The room of twenty or thirty square meters has a few rows of benches. The only highlight is that from the window of the church altar, the South Alps appear so pure and bright in front of the cross. The reason for being famous may be because it is built on the edge of Lake Tekapo, which makes people feel full of peace and beauty.New Zealand · Lake Tekapo","https://my.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/lake-tekapo/the-church-of-the-good-shepherd-95931/?locale=en-MY&curr=MYR","2","https://my.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/oceania-120003/tourist-attractions/2.html/?locale=en-MY&curr=MYR","The Church of the Good Shepherd","Located high on the shores of Lake Tekapo, the Church of the Good Shepherd was built in 1935 and named after a sculpture of a shepherd dog. Made entirely of rock blocks, this church is a classic postcard view of Lake Tekapo. At night, the church under the stars is even more beautiful, and it is also an excellent location for shooting star trails. 1. The appearance of the church is primitive and simple. Although it is not big, it has a unique flavor. The area of the church is only 20 to 30 square meters, which is very small. There is a small stone cross on the north roof, a small bell tower on the west side of the south roof, and a small bronze bell hangs in the arched wall hole. The outer wall of the entire church is a random combination of the original dark gray, light gray, cyan and brown of the rock, while the roof is a black stone piece. Such a primitive and rustic appearance makes it special in this open lakeside wilderness. Harmony and harmony. Although the church is small, it is very famous. During the day, there will be buses with tour groups arriving one after another. At night, you often encounter people who bring professional photography equipment to take pictures of the stars. Walking into the church, there are five or six rows of benches on the left and right sides. From the middle aisle to the pulpit by the window, a cross ten centimeters high stands in front of the glass window, against the light, outside the window is the blue sky and white clouds and the lake water. Great view, with views of Mount Cook in the distance. 2. Bronze statue of a shepherd dog next to the church A towering bronze statue of a shepherd dog can be seen not far from the church. It is used to commemorate the contribution made by the shepherd dog to protecting the flock. The statue is also engraved with ""No Shepherd"". Dogs, there would be no small town today"" and other words. 3. Look up at the starry sky and watch the unique astronomical scene. If you plan to go here in the middle of the night, you need to check whether the weather is fine in advance. When you lie on a bench by the lake and look up at the stars, you can see unique astronomical sights that can only be seen in the southern hemisphere, such as the Southern Cross constellation, the Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way satellite galaxies, etc. If you are lucky, you can even see meteors passing by night sky. With the exception of the Church of the Good Shepherd, the entire Lake Tekapo area is a good spot for stargazing as long as you stay away from street lights. Of course, if the budget is sufficient, you can also sign up for the stargazing cluster on Mount John."

Waitomo in Maori means ""surrounded by green water"". On the wall of the cave, dotted green light dots are layered upon layer upon layer. These green lights flicker on the black water, and the light and shadow are doubled. This is a wonderful world belonging to the green elves. 1. Three caves with different characteristics make up the Glowworm Cave The Glowworm Cave is mainly composed of three caves with different characteristics, Waitomo Glowworm Cave, Ruakuri Cave and Alanui Cave. The Glowworm Cave is a stalactite cave with a history of more than 10,000 years. There was a small ice-covered lake on the mountain of this cave. After the ice and snow melted, it flowed into the cracks in the rock formation below, and gradually eroded into the current cave. Cathedral Cave inside the Waitomo Glowworm Caves, this huge cave is known for its echoes of space. Ruakuri Cave is a legendary underground cave where the sound of water from an underground waterfall can be heard. The entrance of Alanui Cave is the visitor center, and the vaulted greenhouse with membrane structure is very imposing. 2. Thousands of glowworms enter the cave for a tour. You need to take a boat to enter the depths of the cave. After getting on the boat, the guide will pull the guide rope above to push the boat forward. The strange spot of light in the cave is the light emitted by thousands of fireflies. You will find patches of green and white light on the rocks. Looking closely, there are jagged translucent filaments hanging from the ceiling of the cave under the light and shadow. The silk has clear water droplets like a curtain of crystal beads. These beautiful filaments with slime are the firefly's fishing tool to attract and prey on light-following insects. This firefly has only been found in New Zealand and Australia. 3. Black Labyrinth Tour, Abyss Tour and Odyssey Tour In addition to the ""black water rafting"" in the Glowworm Cave, if you are brave enough and your endurance is good enough, you can also experience the Black Labyrinth Tour organized by the legendary black water rafting company , Journey to the Abyss and Journey to the Odyssey.
