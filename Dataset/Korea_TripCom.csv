Sky Park is famous for its 291 steps, from which you can overlook the panoramic view of Seoul. Boundless Grass Sky Park is characterized by a vast expanse of grass. The ridge line made for the convenience of drainage is the boundary line, and it is divided into 4 areas according to the X-shape.

In the rippling purple awn group, citizens can feel the nature. In the low grasslands, there are native varieties such as large thistle, violet and bitterweed, and naturalized varieties such as white alfalfa.
