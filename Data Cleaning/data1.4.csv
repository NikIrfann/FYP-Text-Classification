106,Basel Minster,"The high walls made of red sandstone, the roofs paved with colorful tiles, the towering twin towers, all these make the cathedral one of the important features of Basel. The wine cellar, the choir, the tomb of Erasmus in Rotterdam, the Galluspforte and the two cloisters bear witness to the vicissitudes of the cathedral over the centuries. Basel's history as an urban settlement begins in Chapel Hill. In the first century BC, Celts from the Rauricii tribe lived in the fortified ""oppidum"". Today, the remains of the ""Celtic Wall"" can still be seen in the semi-underground windows of the Rittergasse. In 15 BC, the Roman army established a military base on Chapel Hill on the border between the Roman Empire and the Germanic tribes. In the center of the Münsterplatz square, you can see a hidden Roman well leading to the groundwater of the Rhine. In the late Roman Empire, Christianity was established in the Basel area. Existing documents record bishops who came to Basel from the Roman republic of Augusta Raurica, located about 10 kilometers upstream of the Rhine. But in fact, the names of all the bishops who have lived in Basel since the 8th century are now known. The cathedral dates back to the reign of Charlemagne, and the building was destroyed in 917 when the Hungarians attacked the entire city. At the beginning of the 11th century, Henry II built a magnificent new church for Basel. During the 25 years at the end of the 12th century, the church of Henry's period was replaced by Romanesque buildings, and after the earthquake in 1356, it was renovated into a Gothic church. Around the Münsterplatz square, the priests of the church built their own post-Gothic residences, and the open space was used for commemorative processions, festivals, competitions and grand military parades for visiting people. In 1529, Basel became fully Protestant. Bishops and clergy left the city, and the clergy's empty homes were sold to wealthy merchants. In the 18th century, the church became post-Baroque and Neoclassical, while Münsterplatz became a quiet and prosperous residential area, and later the administrative center of Basel. Today, this magnificent square is used as a venue for various events and an open space for people to meet.",None Related,high walls made red sandstone roofs paved colorful tiles towering twin towers make cathedral one important features basel wine cellar choir tomb erasmus rotterdam galluspforte two cloisters bear witness vicissitudes cathedral centuries basel history urban settlement begins chapel hill first century bc celts rauricii tribe lived fortified oppidum today remains celtic wall still seen windows rittergasse 15 bc roman army established military base chapel hill border roman empire germanic tribes center münsterplatz square see hidden roman well leading groundwater rhine late roman empire christianity established basel area existing documents record bishops came basel roman republic augusta raurica located 10 kilometers upstream rhine fact names bishops lived basel since 8th century known cathedral dates back reign charlemagne building destroyed 917 hungarians attacked entire city beginning 11th century henry ii built magnificent new church basel 25 years end 12th century church henry period replaced romanesque buildings earthquake 1356 renovated gothic church around münsterplatz square priests church built residences open space used commemorative processions festivals competitions grand military parades visiting people 1529 basel became fully protestant bishops clergy left city clergy empty homes sold wealthy merchants 18th century church became neoclassical münsterplatz became quiet prosperous residential area later administrative center basel today magnificent square used venue various events open space people meet

221,Cupola di San Pietro,"The inner diameter of the dome is about 42 meters, covering the entire cathedral. For this big dome, there have been twists and turns for a hundred years, first Bramante designed it in 1506, and Raphael succeeded him after his death in 1514. Six years later, Raphael also passed away. The church borrowed the Gothic design for the top of the church, emphasizing the contrast between darkness and light, and used rose windows. Therefore, out of consideration for the contrast effect of light at the entrance of the church, the round Top was canceled. Michelangelo later took over the job at the age of 71, restoring the dome in the name of ""love for God, for the Virgin, and for St. Peter."" There are eleven statues on the eaves of the dome. The statue of Jesus Christ is in the middle. There is a clock on each side of the eaves. The right is Greenwich time, the left is Roman time.

230,Day Zero Diagnostics,"The future of infectious disease diagnostics starts at Day Zero. By using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and our proprietary enabling technologies, Day Zero is creating a new class of sequencing-based in-vitro diagnostics that generates clinically actionable data at scale. Our technologies include novel sample preparation methods enabling unprecedented ultra-high enrichment of pathogen DNA for sequencing directly from clinical samples, machine learning algorithms that provide clinically actionable diagnostic results, and a world-class database of WGS and drug efficacy profiles. Day Zero Diagnostics is on a mission to transform the way infectious disease diagnostics are performed by generating the stream of real-time sequencing data required to change how we track, manage and combat infectious diseases.

With an enormous unmet clinical and economic need, we are targeting bloodstream infections and sepsis for our first application. The life expectancy of a patient with septic shock is 24 hours without fast effective antibiotic treatment. However, even when successful, current diagnostics take 2-5 days to identify the pathogen AND provide its antibiotic susceptibility profile. The lack of rapid, accurate, and comprehensive diagnostics, forces physicians to “carpet bomb” patients with severe infections with powerful, yet toxic, broad-spectrum antibiotics, which is not only ineffective in many cases but can also lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Day Zero delivers a complete diagnosis, including both the species and antibiotic resistance profile, in hours vs. days, enabling the physician to use a targeted treatment on day zero of hospital admission and resulting in better patient outcomes and cost savings",bioinformatic,future infectious disease diagnostics starts day zero using sequencing wgs proprietary enabling technologies day zero creating new class diagnostics generates clinically actionable data scale technologies include novel sample preparation methods enabling unprecedented enrichment pathogen dna sequencing directly clinical samples machine learning algorithms provide clinically actionable diagnostic results database wgs drug efficacy profiles day zero diagnostics mission transform way infectious disease diagnostics performed generating stream sequencing data required change track manage combat infectious diseases enormous unmet clinical economic need targeting bloodstream infections sepsis first application life expectancy patient septic shock 24 hours without fast effective antibiotic treatment however even successful current diagnostics take days identify pathogen provide antibiotic susceptibility profile lack rapid accurate comprehensive diagnostics forces physicians carpet bomb patients severe infections powerful yet toxic antibiotics ineffective many cases also lead significant morbidity mortality day zero delivers complete diagnosis including species antibiotic resistance profile hours days enabling physician use targeted treatment day zero hospital admission resulting better patient outcomes cost savings

243,Doge's Palace,"The Doge's Palace, built in the ninth century, was the residence of Dodge, the former Doge. The Doge's Palace was originally a Byzantine-style defensive castle, and the huge expenditure when it was established showed the power and wealth of the Republic of Venice at that time. Architectural Style The present building was mainly constructed between 1309 and 1424. In 1574, the Governor's Palace was severely damaged by a fire. Although the designers of the time submitted designs in the neoclassical style, subsequent reconstructions continued the original Gothic style. However, there are also some classicist features, such as the Bridge of Sighs, built since the 16th century, through which the Doge's Palace is connected to the prison. Today, the Doge's Palace is a museum where visitors can admire paintings of Venice depicted by Tintoretto and Veronese. The Governor's Palace, which has a ㄇ-shaped internal structure, is divided into three floors, and the two sides facing the square and the wharf are its main walls. In a geometric pattern of white and rose marble, a solid wall is placed on the third floor, with A-line lace interspersed with gothic flame-shaped minarets on the upper edge. The second floor is a Gothic pointed-vault loggia decorated with four-leaf ornaments, and the Gothic arcade on the lower floor is supported by columns to support the two arches on the second floor. This not only subtly breaks the traditional Gothic design, but also subverts the traditional architectural principles to overcome the problem of the top heavy and the bottom light. It retains the original Byzantine concept and integrates the Gothic design to become a light and slender masterpiece of Venetian Gothic architecture. . Buy a ticket from the ticket entrance on the Slavic Embankment. There is a simple map behind the ticket, indicating the location of the Doge's Palace, St. Mark's Basilica and the adjacent Craft Museum. Many original sculptures from the Doge's Palace are displayed in the Craft Museum. After entering the exhibition hall, you first come to the atrium, which is characterized by Renaissance-style marble carvings. Here you can see the ""onion head"" dome of the adjoining St. Mark's Basilica, with a clock-shaped marble facade on it. The first floor of the cloister on the three sides of the courtyard is a Renaissance-style regular round arch, and the second floor is a Gothic pointed arch, which is different from the Gothic pointed arch in the facade of the Governor's Palace. On the promenade on the second floor, there are several lion mouths in the shape of a lion's head, which are used to receive anonymous reporting letters. The public only needs to put the letter into the mouth of the lion. At that time, the Venice government encouraged whistleblowers and protected whistleblowers. Three locks were specially set up in the mailbox, which must be opened by three persons with three keys. In addition, standing on the sky balcony of the promenade on the second floor, you can overlook St. Mark's Square and the lagoon. There are 8 statues from the ancient Greek period in the courtyard. There are two finely carved bronze water wells on the ground in the courtyard, which are considered to be exquisite works of Venice in the 16th century. This well can absorb water from the outside waterway to the atrium for storage. In the past, it was the best quality water in Venice. Every day, many traders came to the Doge's Palace to fetch water, and then took the well water to distant areas to sell it. Then came to the official starting point of the tour route - the golden stairs, from which you entered the interior of the Governor's Palace. At the entrance of the golden staircase arch, the Hercules on the left is Hercules slaying the snake demon, and the god Atlas on the right is carrying the earth. They are above the stone pillars on the two sides of the entrance to represent the power of Venice symbol of. The golden stairs built in the 16th century were only used by nobles and important guests to enter the palace. The stairs can be said to be resplendent, and the ceiling carvings on the top are actually made of plaster and then decorated with a layer of gold foil. Follow the golden stairs to the third floor of the Governor's Palace. Every room here is as luxurious as possible. From the ceiling to the surrounding walls, there are magnificent decorations everywhere. However, according to the regulations here, photography is not allowed above the second floor. The main halls of the Governor's Mansion include the Map Hall, the Four Entrance Halls, the Conference Hall, the Ten-person Hall, the Elder Hall and the Grand Conference Hall. The walls of the map hall are decorated with world maps, and two huge globes are kept inside. In the conference hall, there is Tintoretto's giant mural ""Paradise"", which is based on Dante's ""The Divine Comedy"". There are more than 700 figures in the painting, which is called the world's largest oil painting. After visiting the various halls, go to the armory displaying various weapons, guns, ammunition and armor, which preserves the weapons of the Crusades, the first machine gun imitated according to Da Vinci's design, and the shocking chastity belt . Then the passage becomes dark and you will come to the cell located in the basement of the Doge's Palace. The number of prison cells at that time was not enough, so a new prison was built next to the palace, which became an independent building for the purpose of imprisoning prisoners in history, and the Bridge of Sighs connecting the two places was also built.",None Related,doge palace built ninth century residence dodge former doge doge palace originally defensive castle huge expenditure established showed power wealth republic venice time architectural style present building mainly constructed 1309 1574 governor palace severely damaged fire although designers time submitted designs neoclassical style subsequent reconstructions continued original gothic style however also classicist features bridge sighs built since 16th century doge palace connected prison today doge palace museum visitors admire paintings venice depicted tintoretto veronese governor palace internal structure divided three floors two sides facing square wharf main walls geometric pattern white rose marble solid wall placed third floor lace interspersed gothic minarets upper edge second floor gothic loggia decorated ornaments gothic arcade lower floor supported columns support two arches second floor subtly breaks traditional gothic design also subverts traditional architectural principles overcome problem top heavy bottom light retains original byzantine concept integrates gothic design become light slender masterpiece venetian gothic architecture buy ticket ticket entrance slavic embankment simple map behind ticket indicating location doge palace mark basilica adjacent craft museum many original sculptures doge palace displayed craft museum entering exhibition hall first come atrium characterized marble carvings see onion head dome adjoining mark basilica marble facade first floor cloister three sides courtyard regular round arch second floor gothic pointed arch different gothic pointed arch facade governor palace promenade second floor several lion mouths shape lion head used receive anonymous reporting letters public needs put letter mouth lion time venice government encouraged whistleblowers protected whistleblowers three locks specially set mailbox must opened three persons three keys addition standing sky balcony promenade second floor overlook mark square lagoon 8 statues ancient greek period courtyard two finely carved bronze water wells ground courtyard considered exquisite works venice 16th century well absorb water outside waterway atrium storage past best quality water venice every day many traders came doge palace fetch water took well water distant areas sell came official starting point tour route golden stairs entered interior governor palace entrance golden staircase arch hercules left hercules slaying snake demon god atlas right carrying earth stone pillars two sides entrance represent power venice symbol golden stairs built 16th century used nobles important guests enter palace stairs said resplendent ceiling carvings top actually made plaster decorated layer gold foil follow golden stairs third floor governor palace every room luxurious possible ceiling surrounding walls magnificent decorations everywhere however according regulations photography allowed second floor main halls governor mansion include map hall four entrance halls conference hall hall elder hall grand conference hall walls map hall decorated world maps two huge globes kept inside conference hall tintoretto giant mural paradise based dante divine comedy 700 figures painting called world largest oil painting visiting various halls go armory displaying various weapons guns ammunition armor preserves weapons crusades first machine gun imitated according da vinci design shocking chastity belt passage becomes dark come cell located basement doge palace number prison cells time enough new prison built next palace became independent building purpose imprisoning prisoners history bridge sighs connecting two places also built

399,Iguassu Waterfalls,"Iguazu Falls in South America is one of the five largest waterfalls in the world. It is very wide. ""Iguazu"" means ""huge water"" in the language of the Guarani people, the indigenous people of South America. The waterfall is located on the border between Argentina and Brazil. In 1984, Iguazu Falls was listed as a World Natural Heritage by UNESCO. The difference between Iguazu Falls is that there are many viewing points. From different locations, different directions, and different heights, you can see different scenes. The entire waterfall group is numerous, majestic and powerful, which is unforgettable for a lifetime. 1. The history of the waterfall In 1542, a Spanish missionary accidentally discovered the Iguazu Falls in the tropical rain forest of the Parana River Basin in South America. The rumbling sound of the waterfall spread dozens of kilometers away. The fact that Iguazu can form such a spectacular waterfall here is inseparable from its geological and geographical conditions. Magma erupted 1.2 billion years ago to form the current terrain. The Paraná River Valley in Brazil is a north-south basalt. The Iguazu River and its riverbed rock formations are just perpendicular to the Paraná River, and the scouring and erosion of the river water is far weaker than that of the Paraná River. Day after day, the level difference of the riverbed is formed at the confluence of the Iguazu River and the Paraná River. After countless days and nights, the majestic Iguazu Falls have formed such a majestic appearance . Until now, the Great Falls are still changing, and will continue to do so. The formation of a basalt highland at the beginning can not help but make people feel full of emotion. 2. A detailed introduction to the waterfall The Iguazu River originates from the Mar Mountains near Curitiba, and flows westward through the Brazilian plateau for 1,320 kilometers before joining the Paraná River. There are as many as 30 large and small rivers along the way. Flowing to the Iguazu Falls, the river widened to 4 kilometers. The Iguazu River runs thousands of miles to the border between the two countries. When it falls steeply from the basalt cliff to the Paraná River Gorge, the river is divided into 275 large and small waterfalls by the rocks and dense trees at the fault, falling into an average The semi-circular waterfall group with a drop of 72 meters. Due to the large amount of water in the river, it converges into a majestic waterfall here, and its water flow reaches 1,700 cubic meters per second. The power, shape and loud noise of Iguazu Falls will only be believed if you experience it for yourself, and the countless bizarre rainbows formed under the reflection of the sun are spectacular. Iguazu Falls far exceeds Niagara Falls in North America in terms of height and width, and the scenery is more majestic. The sound of its waterfalls can be heard 30 kilometers away, which is a wonder on earth. Iguazu Falls is located in the subtropical zone, and the water volume does not change much throughout the year. From January to March, it is the local rainy season, and the flow of the waterfall is large, which is a good viewing season. From August to October, it is the dry season, and the flow of the waterfall is small. 3. The water flow is large and violent. The main part of the river falls from a narrow semi-circular fissure. The scene is described as ""the sea pouring into the abyss"". This section can be seen on both sides of Brazil and Argentina. During the flood season, the width is 3.5 to 4 kilometers, and the drop is 60 to 82 meters. The thunder-like falling sound is 25 kilometers away from the surrounding area, and the splashing fog is like a bead curtain. There is a feeling. 4. Excursion project in the park A few years ago, the Iguazu Falls tourist area was operated by a private company. This company built a tourist plank road about 20 kilometers long, laid electric railways, and the tourist facilities took a new look. In the scenic spot, you can walk along the trestle bridge, or take a tour bus to visit various scenic spots. Intimate contact with the waterfall is a more exciting activity in Foz do Iguaçu - rushing into the waterfall by speedboat, shuttle under the waterfall, very exciting and pleasant. However, this is a self-funded project, the cost is 60 US dollars once, and you need to go downstream first. First, take a sightseeing bus through the jungle (it is said that the seeds of a tree on both sides are specially used for making perfume in France, and some plants are the staple food of the Indians), and then take a jeep down a few particularly steep slopes after disembarking. To the shore speedboat departure point. Visitors need raincoats and life jackets on board the speedboat. The boat is upstream, the speed is relatively fast, and the current is also fast. This is repeated several times, which is very exciting. 5. Differences between Argentina and Brazil The waterfalls are distributed on both sides of the canyon. Argentina and Brazil are bounded by this canyon, and the waterfalls viewed in Argentina and Brazil are also very different. Brazil and Argentina have built national parks on the north and south sides of the waterfall. The Argentine National Park covers an area of 65,000 hectares. In 1975, a green railing bridge was built upstream of the waterfall. to the edge of the waterfall. The park on the Brazilian side is the largest forest reserve in Brazil, with an area of 170,000 hectares, and there are many wild animals in the park.The momentum of rolling down.

513,Leaning Tower of Pisa,"The Leaning Tower of Pisa is an iconic building in Italy and a wonder in the history of world architecture. It was selected as a world cultural heritage by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is actually an independent bell tower of the Cathedral of Pisa, located in the central square of Pisa, the Miracle Square. The square is full of people, and it is common for tourists to stretch out their arms and pose for pictures with the Leaning Tower in all kinds of whimsical shapes. Leaning Tower Construction History and Leaning Reasons The Leaning Tower of Pisa is more than 20 meters away from the cathedral. It has a cylindrical appearance and is made of white marble. The year of construction engraved in Latin on the base of the tower was 1174, and it was completed in 1350; but in fact, the calendar used in ancient Pisa was one year earlier than the Gregorian calendar, so the year of construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was 1173. It is said that the Leaning Tower of Pisa was built with six trophies brought in by the Pisa fleet. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is 54.5 meters high and 16 meters in diameter. In the early stages of construction, the leaning tower tilted an average of 1 mm per year, and construction was temporarily suspended. Most believe the slope is due to uneven foundations and soft soil layers. In 1998, workers wrapped cables on the third tier, attached it to the frame, and removed some of the deposited soil to the north to bring the leaning tower into equilibrium. There are 213 arches on each floor of the leaning tower overlooking the city of Pisa. There are 294 spiral steps in the tower, for tourists to climb the tower and overlook the scenery of the whole city. Some steps are slippery, so you need to pay attention to your feet. In summer evenings, you can enjoy the beautiful night view of Pisa from the Leaning Tower. The experience of entering the Leaning Tower is very special. When you walk down the very narrow spiral staircase, you will feel as if you are on a boat. When you reach the top of the tower, the vision is suddenly clear. There is glass at the top of the tower, because the interior of the tower is hollow, so the ground floor can be seen directly through the glass. The process of climbing the tower is now limited by time and number of people. You need to go to the ticket office to book tickets in advance, or if you want to avoid long queues, you can buy tickets on the official website and print them out. Ticket holders to the summit should gather at the designated place in advance. The staff will first introduce the history of the Leaning Tower for 5 minutes, and then a special person will lead the team to climb the tower.

The Louvre Museum was founded in 1204. The castle has undergone many expansions and was converted into a museum after the French Revolution. It is also known as the three major museums in the world together with the British Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Today, the Louvre Museum has a collection of 400,000 items spanning more than 1,500 years. The Louvre Museum usually displays 10% of its total collection which will feast your eyes.""Three Treasures of the Louvre"": ""Venus de Milo"", ""Mona Lisa"" and "" The Winged Victory of Samothrace"".
△ The Louvre’s gallery of antiquities, which replaced the royal apartments, displays masterpieces of Greek sculpture – including the famous Venus de Milo. You would need a heart of stone not to be moved by her grace!Aphrodite or Amphitrite?When she first arrived at the Louvre, it was suggested that her missing arms should be restored, but the idea was eventually abandoned for fear of changing the nature of the work.The lack of arms made it hard to identify the statue. Many depictions of Greek gods and goddesses contain clues to their identity in the form of ‘attributes’ (objects or natural elements) held in their hands, so this sculpture poses a problem: is she the sea goddess Amphitrite, particularly worshipped on the island of Melos? Or is she Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty, as might be suggested by her sensual, half-naked body? This second argument, and the jewellery she once wore, tipped the scales in favour of Aphrodite (‘Venus’ for the Romans). Another possible clue was found near the statue: a hand holding an apple – an attribute of Aphrodite – carved from the same Parian marble.
△ This is the most famous portrait in the world. It shows Lisa Gherardini, wife of the Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo – hence her Italian name La Gioconda and her French name La Joconde. Painted against a distant landscape, she stares out at us with her famously enigmatic smile...The theft of the centuryOn 21 August 1911, panic broke out at the Louvre…the Mona Lisa had disappeared! The news spread like wildfire and generous rewards were promised for her return – but all in vain. Nothing was heard of the painting for over two years. Then one day, Vincenzo Peruggia, a glazier who had worked at the Louvre, tried to sell the world’s most famous painting to an Italian art dealer...who alerted the authorities. So the Mona Lisa was recovered – and her fame was all the greater.
△ She seems to float through the air! Placed at a height, people could see her from afar. It was made as an offering to the gods for a sanctuary on the Greek island of Samothrace. Placed at a height, people could see her from afar. That is why, in a nod to her original lofty home, she now adorns the top of the Daru staircase. Nike, the winged goddess who heralds victory, is seen just as she is about to alight on a ship.A monumental staircaseThe Daru staircase is the perfect setting for this extraordinary display. It is one of six grand staircases built during the Second Empire in the 19th century by the architect Hector Lefuel.During the 1850s and 1860s, major works were underway to expand the Louvre and make it more modern. The former palace had already been partially transformed into a museum. The emperor Napoleon III had a new wing built to make more room to showcase more art. The old staircase built by his uncle Napoleon I was no longer adequate to access all the galleries. The only things left from that time are the ceilings leading to the Italian painting collections and the name Daru, a minister under Napoleon I.Hector Lefuel took up the challenge to design a new monumental space on three levels leading in four different directions. Visitors could choose themselves which way to go!The Winged Victory of Samothrace was placed in her new home on the upper landing in 1883, some 20 years after the statue was discovered.",None Related,charm locations movies phantom louvre da vinci code gorgeous treasures ancient greece ancient rome ancient egypt giant glass pyramid combines classical palaces modern architectural styles louvre museum founded castle undergone many expansions converted museum french revolution also known three major museums world together british museum london metropolitan museum new york today louvre museum collection items spanning years louvre museum usually displays 10 total collection feast eyes three treasures louvre venus de milo mona lisa winged victory samothrace louvre gallery antiquities replaced royal apartments displays masterpieces greek sculpture including famous venus de milo would need heart stone moved grace aphrodite amphitrite first arrived louvre suggested missing arms restored idea eventually abandoned fear changing nature lack arms made hard identify statue many depictions greek gods goddesses contain clues identity form attributes objects natural elements held hands sculpture poses problem sea goddess amphitrite particularly worshipped island melos aphrodite goddess beauty might suggested sensual body second argument jewellery wore tipped scales favour aphrodite venus romans another possible clue found near statue hand holding apple attribute aphrodite carved parian marble famous portrait world shows lisa gherardini wife florentine silk merchant francesco del giocondo hence italian name la gioconda french name la joconde painted distant landscape stares us famously enigmatic smile theft centuryon 21 august 1911 panic broke mona lisa disappeared news spread like wildfire generous rewards promised return vain nothing heard painting two years one day vincenzo peruggia glazier worked louvre tried sell world famous painting italian art dealer alerted authorities mona lisa recovered fame greater seems float air placed height people could see afar made offering gods sanctuary greek island samothrace placed height people could see afar nod original lofty home adorns top daru staircase nike winged goddess heralds victory seen alight monumental staircasethe daru staircase perfect setting extraordinary display one six grand staircases built second empire 19th century architect hector 1850s 1860s major works underway expand louvre make modern former palace already partially transformed museum emperor napoleon iii new wing built make room showcase art old staircase built uncle napoleon longer adequate access galleries things left time ceilings leading italian painting collections name daru minister napoleon lefuel took challenge design new monumental space three levels leading four different directions visitors could choose way go winged victory samothrace placed new home upper landing 1883 20 years statue discovered

Fort Saint-Michel and its bay were declared a World Heritage Site in 1979. The mystical and isolated island of Fort Saint-Michel is located in a conical arrangement of small islands made of towering granite. The bay of Saint-Malo where it is located is a tidal flat, and the tides continuously wash the sediment ashore, making the Fort Saint-Michel an isolated island, which only rises to the sea when the tide is high, which is quite mysterious.

To get to Fort St. Michel, you can take a car through the embankment road, or you can choose a walking plank road to enjoy the beautiful view of Fort St. Michel surrounded by the sea. Tide Watching Guide To watch the tide at Fort Saint-Michel is one of the main purposes of most tourists. The tide season is generally in spring every year, and the tidal drop can be as high as 15 meters. The parking lot at the foot of the mountain will also be submerged when the tide is high. Since the bay has little deep water and a flat bottom, the sea is 15 to 20 kilometers away from the shore at low tide. Usually the speed of high tide is equivalent to a person's walking speed - 4 kilometers per hour, and the speed increases to 30 kilometers per hour when the wind is down. Every evening, the tide of the Atlantic Ocean rushed over like a galloping horse, submerging the quicksand on the side of the mountain, and the holy mountain suddenly turned into an ocean. 6 hours after the high tide, the tide is low, and the low tide of the bay often starts very suddenly. Maybe a few minutes ago, the sea was endless and unfathomable, and suddenly the sea receded into the distance, and the beach was bare and the color on the beach was everywhere. Very special quicksand.

800,Putra Mosque,"The Pink Mosque is located in Putrajaya, the new administrative center of Malaysia. Three-quarters of the entire mosque is built on Lake Brat, also known as the Water Mosque. It's visually stunning thanks to its pink dome topped with granite. The construction of the mosque started in 1997 at a huge cost and can accommodate 15,000 people. The exterior is all pink, quite soft in color, and built with a lot of rose marble. The mosque has nine domes and can reach a height of 50 meters. Standing on Prince Edward Square is a good spot to photograph the exterior of the mosque. Between the blue sky, white clouds and clear water, the pink sanctuary is so beautiful that you can't take your eyes off it. It is not like the Forbidden City in Beijing, as red as a red flame rose. This mosque is more like a pink holy lotus blooming on the water, with a clear rhythm and a pure dream. The mosque is mainly composed of three parts: the prayer hall, the big minaret and the mausoleum. The roof of the hall looks like an open umbrella. It consists of 49 large and small round arches with 18 radiating stars, representing the 13 states of the country and the five commandments of Islam. The shape of the spire of the big minaret is like a rocket, the whole tower is 73 meters high, and there are elevators and stairs leading to the upper end. The mausoleum is built behind the mosque, where only the national heroes of Islam are buried. Most of the people who came to the mosque were tour groups from China and India. Because of time constraints, most of these tour groups just took pictures on the outside. If you are an independent tourist, you can visit it if you have enough time, because the interior of the mosque is actually more magnificent than the dreamy appearance. There is a red sign at the entrance of the mosque that says that non-Muslims, women who are menstruating and children under the age of five are not allowed to enter the prayer hall. All visitors must be properly dressed and not revealing when entering. Quiet loud noises in the temple, no smoking. Therefore, whether it is a boy or a girl, you can get a red or blue robe for free at the entrance, wear it on your body, and wear a hat at the same time. Girls can't show their hair, and there will be staff reminding them all the time. In addition, the shoes must also be taken off, you can put them on the rack specially for shoes, just remember where you put them. After entering, there will be a staff member who will explain it for free. Photography is prohibited in the prayer hall, please strictly abide by it. There are no idols in the temple, because Muslims do their prayers in the direction of Mecca. The mosque is divided into two floors, the second floor can be used exclusively by 4,000 women, and the downstairs can be used by 8,000 men. Muslims will worship at a certain time every day. At this time, the sound of the Koran played in the high minaret of the mosque lingers melodiously in the sky above the mosque, which is very pleasant. The design of the mosque is quite environmentally friendly. The prayer hall is very spacious. There are 12 pillars in it. The center of the pillars is a vacuum design. When the weather is hot, the motor at the bottom of the lake can be pumped into the interior, so it will feel slightly cool when entering the mosque. In addition, you can also see some Koran decorations in the temple, and there is a yellow explanatory diagram on the wall, telling people the correct mode of worship.

990,Temple of Poseidon,"There are many sea temples built to commemorate Poseidon. One of the famous sea temples is located in Cape Sounion, southeast of Athens, at the southern tip of the Attica peninsula, about 70 kilometers away from Athens. The temple stands on a cliff about 65 meters high, which is the best place to enjoy the view of the Aegean Sea and sunset. Cape Sunu is surrounded by the sea on three sides, with the Aegean Sea on the left, the Mediterranean Sea on the front, and the Ionian Sea on the right. In the past, Athenians believed that places with better views were suitable for building temples for the gods of worship. The Temple of Poseidon was built in 444-440 BC to protect sailors going out to sea and pray for good weather, before it was destroyed by the Byzantine Emperor Arcadios in 399 BC. Climbing up the hillside on the west side of the parking lot at Cape Sounion, you can see the charming style of this temple: Like other temples in Greece, the Temple of Poseidon is rectangular, about 80 meters long and 60 meters wide. There are 34 marble columns in total, but only 13 of them have been preserved. The stone columns are about 6 meters high and adopt the Doric style. The Temple of Agriculture is similar. The relief decorations on the stone pillars depict scenes of the battle of the gods, and some of the original reliefs are currently in the collection of the Acropolis Museum. When the poet Byron visited Greece in the 19th century, he carved his name on a column of the temple of Tanah Lot. The location, construction and design of the Temple of Poseidon make it conspicuous from the sea and visible to the naked eye from a distance. This gave great help to ancient ships. Returning sailors can also rely on it to identify their direction.

As well as being one of Paris's famous landmarks, this is a quintessential symbol of Montmartre. Sacré-Cœur's architectural style is interesting, mixing a Romano-Byzantine design while the curved white domes are rather oriental in form.

In the giant transparent cylindrical pipes, the escalators are busy transporting visitors to various floors, and you can also enjoy the scenery outside through the glass when taking the elevator.

1001,The Church of the Good Shepherd,"Located high on the shores of Lake Tekapo, the Church of the Good Shepherd was built in 1935 and named after a sculpture of a shepherd dog. Made entirely of rock blocks, this church is a classic postcard view of Lake Tekapo. At night, the church under the stars is even more beautiful, and it is also an excellent location for shooting star trails. 1. The appearance of the church is primitive and simple. Although it is not big, it has a unique flavor. The area of the church is only 20 to 30 square meters, which is very small. There is a small stone cross on the north roof, a small bell tower on the west side of the south roof, and a small bronze bell hangs in the arched wall hole. The outer wall of the entire church is a random combination of the original dark gray, light gray, cyan and brown of the rock, while the roof is a black stone piece. Such a primitive and rustic appearance makes it special in this open lakeside wilderness. Harmony and harmony. Although the church is small, it is very famous. During the day, there will be buses with tour groups arriving one after another. At night, you often encounter people who bring professional photography equipment to take pictures of the stars. Walking into the church, there are five or six rows of benches on the left and right sides. From the middle aisle to the pulpit by the window, a cross ten centimeters high stands in front of the glass window, against the light, outside the window is the blue sky and white clouds and the lake water. Great view, with views of Mount Cook in the distance. 2. Bronze statue of a shepherd dog next to the church A towering bronze statue of a shepherd dog can be seen not far from the church. It is used to commemorate the contribution made by the shepherd dog to protecting the flock. The statue is also engraved with ""No Shepherd"". Dogs, there would be no small town today"" and other words. 3. Look up at the starry sky and watch the unique astronomical scene. If you plan to go here in the middle of the night, you need to check whether the weather is fine in advance. When you lie on a bench by the lake and look up at the stars, you can see unique astronomical sights that can only be seen in the southern hemisphere, such as the Southern Cross constellation, the Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way satellite galaxies, etc. If you are lucky, you can even see meteors passing by night sky.

1051,Twelve Apostles,"The Twelve Apostles, located in Port Campbell National Park on the Great Ocean Road, is a well-known scenic spot on the Great Ocean Road, attracting a large number of tourists every year. 1. The origin of the Twelve Apostles Rock The Twelve Apostles Rock is actually a rock standing in the sea. It was originally a part of the coastline. After the erosion of waves and strong winds, it gradually broke away. Because these twelve stone pillars are reminiscent of the twelve apostles who followed Jesus Christ in the Bible, they are named ""Twelve Apostles"". Due to the continued alluvial action of the waves, only seven remain. 2. Gibson Steps There is a well-known step on the way to the Twelve Apostles, called Gibson Steps, which is excavated from the cliff. The steps are 100 meters long, with a total of 86 steps, and it takes about 15 minutes to go back and forth. Steps lead to the beach, but the waves here are rough, not suitable for swimming, but suitable for fishing. The width of the steps is about 1 meter, which is only enough for one person to pass, so tourists with limited mobility should not try it easily. At the end, you can see the endless blue sea and two huge stone pillars. The steps are about a 2-minute drive from the rock, and there is a parking lot nearby. The parking is very convenient. After getting off the car, visitors can go from the Twelve Apostles parking lot through the gravel walking trail to the Gibson Steps. The best time to photograph the Twelve Apostles is in the early morning and at dusk. It is even more shocking to take a helicopter to overlook it. In addition, you can also participate in sea fishing, golf, water sports and other projects here. 3. Although the Twelve Apostles Rock of London Bridge and Arch is the highlight of the Great Ocean Road, there are still many places to play along the Great Ocean Road. Attractions such as London Bridge and Arch are not far away and can be visited together. The arches are suitable for viewing in the afternoon, when the view is bathed in a warm golden sun. Co-located in Port Campbell National Park are the Shipwreck Coast and La Card Canyon, only a 10-minute drive from the Twelve Apostles. Due to the rugged terrain in this area, many shipwrecks have occurred here. The sand here is soft and the views are spectacular, perfect for photography.

Collections in the museum Although the museum occupies a small area, its collection of masterpieces is numerous. For example, the dome painting ""Genesis"" created by Michelangelo is collected here, which is very worth seeing. At the same time, for friends who love archaeology, some ancient Greek and Roman cultural relics collected in the museum are also worth studying. Of course, in addition to the collections inside, the architectural style of the museum itself is also commendable. The ancient exterior wall like a city wall, the spiral ramp at the exit, and the sculpture ""Broken Earth"" in the Pinecone Courtyard are all worth savoring. Visiting Guide Pinecone Courtyard Entering the museum, the first thing to visit is the Pinecone Courtyard, which retains the style of the 16th century European viewing courtyard. The famous sculpture ""Broken Earth"" is the sculptor Arnaldo ? Pomodoro's work. At the northern end of the courtyard, there is a giant bronze pine cone tree about 4 meters high. There are two bronze peacocks on both sides of the tree. This is a replica of the second century AD, and the original is kept in the museum. On one side of the courtyard is an illustration of the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel, which you can take a look at before visiting. After entering from the iron gate on the right side of the courtyard, there is the Greco-Roman Sculpture Gallery, including the Museo Chiaramonti, the Room of Busts of the Museo Pio-Clementino, and the New Wing Showroom. (BraccioNuovo). The Nile is the larger statue in the Au Clemence Museum. This group of Nile gods is a monumental sculpture, revealing the fact that Greek art was heavily influenced by Egyptian art. The Pio Clementino Museum then goes to the Cortile Ottagono of the Museo Pio Clementino, which is the famous statue exhibition area, two of the three treasures of the museum in the museum The statue works are here, ""Laocón"" and ""Apollo"".

The other exhibition hall is circular, so it is also called the circular exhibition hall, transliterated as the ""Rotonda"" exhibition hall. The large plate in the center of the exhibition hall is very conspicuous, and it is recorded that it is the bathtub of the Roman emperor Nero. Continuing to visit, we came to the Museum of Muse. The statue of the Muse here is peaceful and elegant, which is simply a model of ancient Roman beauty. But they can only stand aside, because there is another treasure of the town hall - ""Remnant Body"". The life of the Greek statue is full of all parts of the body, even if only the broken arm is left, it can still give people vitality and beauty. The statue is placed in the center of the pavilion, and the ceiling at the top is also worth noting.

Raphael is magnificent and beautiful. Decorated with frescoes, it consists of four consecutive rooms, of which the fresco work ""School of Athens"" in the signature room is considered one of Raphael's great masterpieces.

These green lights flicker on the black water, and the light and shadow are doubled. This is a wonderful world belonging to the green elves. 1. Three caves with different characteristics make up the Glowworm Cave The Glowworm Cave is mainly composed of three caves with different characteristics, Waitomo Glowworm Cave, Ruakuri Cave and Alanui Cave. The Glowworm Cave is a stalactite cave with a history of more than 10,000 years. There was a small ice-covered lake on the mountain of this cave. After the ice and snow melted, it flowed into the cracks in the rock formation below, and gradually eroded into the current cave. Cathedral Cave inside the Waitomo Glowworm Caves, this huge cave is known for its echoes of space. Ruakuri Cave is a legendary underground cave where the sound of water from an underground waterfall can be heard. The entrance of Alanui Cave is the visitor center, and the vaulted greenhouse with membrane structure is very imposing. 2. Thousands of glowworms enter the cave for a tour. You need to take a boat to enter the depths of the cave. After getting on the boat, the guide will pull the guide rope above to push the boat forward. The strange spot of light in the cave is the light emitted by thousands of fireflies. You will find patches of green and white light on the rocks. Looking closely, there are jagged translucent filaments hanging from the ceiling of the cave under the light and shadow. The silk has clear water droplets like a curtain of crystal beads. These beautiful filaments with slime are the firefly's fishing tool to attract and prey on light-following insects. This firefly has only been found in New Zealand and Australia. 3. Black Labyrinth Tour, Abyss Tour and Odyssey Tour In addition to the ""black water rafting"" in the Glowworm Cave, if you are brave enough and your endurance is good enough, you can also experience the Black Labyrinth Tour organized by the legendary black water rafting company , Journey to the Abyss and Journey to the Odyssey.
