The tide season is generally in spring every year, and the tidal drop can be as high as 15 meters. The parking lot at the foot of the mountain will also be submerged when the tide is high. Since the bay has little deep water and a flat bottom, the sea is 15 to 20 kilometers away from the shore at low tide. Usually the speed of high tide is equivalent to a person's walking speed - 4 kilometers per hour, and the speed increases to 30 kilometers per hour when the wind is down. Every evening, the tide of the Atlantic Ocean rushed over like a galloping horse, submerging the quicksand on the side of the mountain, and the holy mountain suddenly turned into an ocean. 6 hours after the high tide, the tide is low, and the low tide of the bay often starts very suddenly.

△ The Louvre’s gallery of antiquities, which replaced the royal apartments, displays masterpieces of Greek sculpture – including the famous Venus de Milo. You would need a heart of stone not to be moved by her grace!Aphrodite or Amphitrite?When she first arrived at the Louvre, it was suggested that her missing arms should be restored, but the idea was eventually abandoned for fear of changing the nature of the work.The lack of arms made it hard to identify the statue. Many depictions of Greek gods and goddesses contain clues to their identity in the form of ‘attributes’ (objects or natural elements) held in their hands, so this sculpture poses a problem: is she the sea goddess Amphitrite, particularly worshipped on the island of Melos? Or is she Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty, as might be suggested by her sensual, half-naked body? This second argument, and the jewellery she once wore, tipped the scales in favour of Aphrodite (‘Venus’ for the Romans). Another possible clue was found near the statue: a hand holding an apple – an attribute of Aphrodite – carved from the same Parian marble.

The emperor Napoleon III had a new wing built to make more room to showcase more art. The old staircase built by his uncle Napoleon I was no longer adequate to access all the galleries. The only things left from that time are the ceilings leading to the Italian painting collections and the name Daru, a minister under Napoleon I.Hector Lefuel took up the challenge to design a new monumental space on three levels leading in four different directions.

From different locations, different directions, and different heights, you can see different scenes. The entire waterfall group is numerous, majestic and powerful, which is unforgettable for a lifetime. 1. The history of the waterfall In 1542, a Spanish missionary accidentally discovered the Iguazu Falls in the tropical rain forest of the Parana River Basin in South America. The rumbling sound of the waterfall spread dozens of kilometers away. The fact that Iguazu can form such a spectacular waterfall here is inseparable from its geological and geographical conditions. Magma erupted 1.2 billion years ago to form the current terrain. The Paraná River Valley in Brazil is a north-south basalt. The Iguazu River and its riverbed rock formations are just perpendicular to the Paraná River, and the scouring and erosion of the river water is far weaker than that of the Paraná River. Day after day, the level difference of the riverbed is formed at the confluence of the Iguazu River and the Paraná River. After countless days and nights, the majestic Iguazu Falls have formed such a majestic appearance . Until now, the Great Falls are still changing, and will continue to do so. The formation of a basalt highland at the beginning can not help but make people feel full of emotion. 2. A detailed introduction to the waterfall The Iguazu River originates from the Mar Mountains near Curitiba, and flows westward through the Brazilian plateau for 1,320 kilometers before joining the Paraná River. There are as many as 30 large and small rivers along the way. Flowing to the Iguazu Falls, the river widened to 4 kilometers. The Iguazu River runs thousands of miles to the border between the two countries. When it falls steeply from the basalt cliff to the Paraná River Gorge, the river is divided into 275 large and small waterfalls by the rocks and dense trees at the fault, falling into an average The semi-circular waterfall group with a drop of 72 meters. Due to the large amount of water in the river, it converges into a majestic waterfall here, and its water flow reaches 1,700 cubic meters per second. The power, shape and loud noise of Iguazu Falls will only be believed if you experience it for yourself, and the countless bizarre rainbows formed under the reflection of the sun are spectacular. Iguazu Falls far exceeds Niagara Falls in North America in terms of height and width, and the scenery is more majestic. The sound of its waterfalls can be heard 30 kilometers away, which is a wonder on earth. Iguazu Falls is located in the subtropical zone, and the water volume does not change much throughout the year. From January to March, it is the local rainy season, and the flow of the waterfall is large, which is a good viewing season. From August to October, it is the dry season, and the flow of the waterfall is small. 3. The water flow is large and violent. The main part of the river falls from a narrow semi-circular fissure. The scene is described as ""the sea pouring into the abyss"". This section can be seen on both sides of Brazil and Argentina. During the flood season, the width is 3.5 to 4 kilometers, and the drop is 60 to 82 meters.

Excursion project in the park A few years ago, the Iguazu Falls tourist area was operated by a private company. This company built a tourist plank road about 20 kilometers long, laid electric railways, and the tourist facilities took a new look.

To the shore speedboat departure point. Visitors need raincoats and life jackets on board the speedboat. The boat is upstream, the speed is relatively fast, and the current is also fast. This is repeated several times, which is very exciting. 5. Differences between Argentina and Brazil The waterfalls are distributed on both sides of the canyon. Argentina and Brazil are bounded by this canyon, and the waterfalls viewed in Argentina and Brazil are also very different. Brazil and Argentina have built national parks on the north and south sides of the waterfall. The Argentine National Park covers an area of 65,000 hectares.
